Central to our mission is the integration of the CQRS and Event Sourcing execution environments. With CQRS, we aim to enhance efficiency by distinctly managing read and write operations. On the other hand, Event Sourcing allows for the precise chronicling of application states through event sequences. Collectively, these modules ensure a streamlined command dispatching, robust event storage, and adept state management on the omnichain, providing an enriched environment for the deployment of smart contracts. 🌐🤖🛠️👨‍💻.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| 0a. | License | https://github.com/Collective-Intelligence-Labs/cila-substrate/blob/main/LICENSE-APACHE.txt | Provision of an Apache License.| \n| 0b. | Documentation | https://github.com/Collective-Intelligence-Labs/cila-substrate/tree/main/docs | Comprehensive documentation to facilitate users and developers. | \n| 0c. | Testing and Testing Guide | https://github.com/Collective-Intelligence-Labs/cila-substrate/blob/main/README.md | A thorough testing procedure and accompanying guide.| \n| 0d. | Docker | https://github.com/Collective-Intelligence-Labs/cila-substrate/blob/main/Dockerfile | Dockerfile to build and run the project in a containerized environment.| \n| 1. | Event Store | https://github.com/Collective-Intelligence-Labs/cila-substrate/blob/main/pallets/event-store/src/lib.rs | Development and integration of the event store.| \n| 2.  | Dispatcher | https://github.com/Collective-Intelligence-Labs/cila-substrate/blob/main/pallets/dispatcher/src/lib.rs  | Implementation of the dispatcher module for operation commands dispatching handling. | \n| 3.  | Aggregate | https://github.com/Collective-Intelligence-Labs/cila-substrate/blob/main/common/src/aggregate.rs | A module offering CQRS aggregate implementation. | \n| 4.  | Event | https://github.com/Collective-Intelligence-Labs/cila-substrate/blob/main/proto/src/event.rs |  Definition of events. | \n| 5.  | Command | https://github.com/Collective-Intelligence-Labs/cila-substrate/blob/main/proto/src/command.rs |  Definition of commands. | \n| 6.  | Operations | https://github.com/Collective-Intelligence-Labs/cila-substrate/blob/main/proto/src/operation.rs |  Definition of operation. | \n\n\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nThe cila-substrate project, hosted under the Collective-Intelligence-Labs repository, represents a concerted effort to bring advanced event sourcing and command query responsibility segregation (CQRS) principles to the Substrate framework. The focus on robust modularization, evident from the diversified pallets and proto modules, ensures that the solution remains scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to evolving requirements.\n\nHere's a brief overview of what each significant component achieves:\n\nLicensing: The Apache License is chosen for this project. It is a permissive free software license, which allows users to use the software for any purpose, to distribute it, to modify it, and to distribute modified versions of the software under the terms of the license, without concern for royalties.\n\nDocumentation: Comprehensive documentation is provided to ensure that both users and developers can easily understand, deploy, and modify the system as necessary. It serves as the primary point of reference for troubleshooting, system understanding, and feature exploration.\n\nDocker Integration: The inclusion of a Dockerfile signifies the project's commitment to reproducibility, portability, and ease of deployment. By containerizing the application, users can be assured of consistent behavior across different environments.\n\nEvent Store, Dispatcher, and Aggregate: These components form the backbone of the event-sourcing model implemented in the project. By segregating events, dispatch mechanisms, and aggregation functionalities, the solution ensures a clean separation of concerns and a high degree of modularity.\n\nProtocols (Event, Command, Operations): The protocol definitions encapsulate the data models and interaction paradigms that the system adheres to. They ensure that there's a consistent structure to the messages and operations, paving the way for smooth interactions and future integrations.\n\nAs the project continues to evolve, contributors and stakeholders can expect periodic updates, optimizations, and feature additions. Feedback from the community is highly valued and will be instrumental in shaping the roadmap for cila-substrate.\n\nFor developers interested in contributing, it's recommended to familiarize oneself with the documentation and set up a local development environment using the provided Docker configurations. Collaboration, code reviews, and open discussions are encouraged to maintain the project's high-quality standards.\n\nEnd-users and developers alike are encouraged to reach out with questions, suggestions, or issues through the project's GitHub issue tracker. The cila-substrate team is committed to providing timely responses and ensuring a vibrant, supportive community ecosystem.",

Richard Casey from Parity brought this program to our attention, and we have already successfully delivered two applications as a result.\n\n- During our inquiries for this application, we briefly consulted Sam Ruberti from the ink! Team and David Hawig from the Web3 Foundation. Their encouragement motivated us to proceed with this presentation.\n\n- Next Steps: After finishing this Milestone 1, and having a good understanding of which missing functionalities in the integration testing environment can be developed, as well as an estimation of the effort required to develop them, we will submit a new grant proposal for a second milestone. The intention of this second milestone is to effectively implement these missing features.\n",

This milestone focuses on the infrastructure integration part of DINFRA MVP. The interface to connect DINFRA to Cloud infrastructure.\n\nAfter analyzing all potentials interfaces to integrate Substrate Parachain and the Chain Reactor we decided to adopt an specialized sidecar pattern for the parachain. A component called OGate. This interface is a milestone 2 deliverable but is partly delivered now because it comes with a parachain SIMULATOR that allows to simulate the parachain during Chain Reactor Development and QA.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| -----: | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| **0a.** | License | Link | Apache 2.0 |\n| **0b.** | Documentation | [Link](https://gitlab.com/dinfra/dinfra/-/tree/MILESTONE1#about-dinfra) [Link](https://gitlab.com/dinfra/dinfra/-/tree/MILESTONE1/packages/acs-reactor#reference-implementation-chain-reactor) | We delivered module markdown documentation, **inline documentation** of the code and a testing **tutorial** as well as how to implement a Chain Reactor. |\n| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide | [Link](https://gitlab.com/dinfra/dinfra/-/tree/MILESTONE1#testing-guide) [Link](https://gitlab.com/dinfra/dinfra/-/pipelines/951071017) | Delivered unit tests, CD pipelines, to ensure functionality and robustness.

After the delivery of this grant, we have completed the service presentation protocol layer, the basic security items in the SQoS layer, and the belief verification algorithms in the consensus layer.  \nWith the help of current work of Dante Network, remote invocations can be made between smart contracts deployed on Polkadot Parachains and smart contracts/resources deployed on other ecosystems. The detailed deployment information can be found at [Testnet](https://github.com/dantenetwork/testnet). And we provide [SDKs](https://github.com/dantenetwork/On-Chain-SDK) for easier development of omniverse-dApps.  \n#### **Future Work**  \nWe persist in developing Dante Protocol in an absolutely decentralized way, so there might be still a long way to go.  \n  * First, we are building advanced features of Dante Protocol to achieve higher and more efficient security. A commitment verification mechanism based on cryptographic algorithms and a multi-layer gaming model will be built to make a prisoner's dilemma, in which the best strategy for off-chain routers is to do honest things.  \n  * Besides, an Omniverse Token Protocol based on Dante Protocol is to be implemented. This kind of token can be accessed from all chains we support without any bridge. So we can help DOT to be Omniverse without any additional work, that is, if someone transfers some DOTs on Polkadot, the same ownership transfer will happen on all connected chains.  \n  * In addition, in the future, Dante Protocol will be implemented as a pallet for substrate, and everyone can integrate this pallet into their Parachains.\n \n",

The list of the things we did in this milestone:\n\n- Created the Address Book which contains all the functionality we promised to do in the grant application.\n- Tests for the address book contract. We have not only written integration tests but also e2e tests since the contract is doing cross-contract calling with the Identity contract.\n- Address book contract and transaction router documentation. We have added a lot of commetns in the code, as well as in the tests to make sure everything is easy to understand.\n- We added token routing which is by far the most complex component in this milestone. We support \n    1. non-cross-chain transfers\n    2.  teleport transfers, this utilises the existing `limited_teleport_assets` extrinsic\n    3. reserve transfers from the reserve chain, this utilises the existing `limited_reserve_transfer_assets` extrinsic\n    4. reserve transfers to the reserve chain, this is a more complex case and we have written a custom XCM program to do this.\n    5. two-hop reserve transfer, this is the most complex case there is and we have written a custom XCM program to do this also.\n- We decided to utilise XCM for non-cross-chain transfers also, since this way we do not make any assumptions on the pallets the chains implement other than the fact that we require the xcm pallet.\n- For getting all the assets on all polkadot and kusama chains we use the [XCM Global Asset Registry](https://github.com/colorfulnotion/xcm-global-registry).\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| 0a. | License | [Contract](https://github.com/TheDotflow/dotflow-ink/blob/main/LICENSE) [Frontend](https://github.com/TheDotflow/dotflow-ui/blob/main/LICENSE) | MIT license | \n| 0b.  | Documentation | [Link](https://github.com/TheDotflow/dotflow-ink/blob/main/README.md) |  | \n| 0c.  | Testing and Testing Guide | [Address Book Ingegration tests](https://github.com/TheDotflow/dotflow-ink/blob/main/contracts/address_book/tests.rs) [Address Book e2e tests](https://github.com/TheDotflow/dotflow-ink/blob/main/contracts/address_book/lib.rs#L239) [UI e2e tests](https://github.com/TheDotflow/dotflow-ui/tree/main/__tests__) [UI reserve transfer unit test](https://github.com/TheDotflow/dotflow-ui/blob/main/src/utils/transactionRouter/reserveTransfer.test.ts) [Frontend test guide](https://github.com/TheDotflow/dotflow-ui#running-tests) [Contract test guide](https://github.com/TheDotflow/dotflow-ink#build--test-locally) | Tests for the address book contract, Tests for the cross-chain, non-cross-chain, teleport transfers and other utility tests |\n| 0d.  | Docker | [Contract](https://github.com/TheDotflow/dotflow-ink#docker) [Frontend](https://github.com/TheDotflow/dotflow-ui#run-with-docker) |  |\n| 0d.  | Medium article | [Article](https://medium.com/@sakacszergej/dotflow-6326f71dd97b) |  |\n| 1.  | Address Book Contract | [Link](https://github.com/TheDotflow/dotflow-ink/tree/main/contracts/address_book) | The code of the address book contract | \n| 2.  | Routing functionality | [Link](https://github.com/TheDotflow/dotflow-ui/tree/main/src/utils/transactionRouter) | The code containing the routing functionality | \n| 3.  | Address Book page | [Link](https://github.com/TheDotflow/dotflow-ui/blob/main/src/pages/address_book.tsx) | The frontend code | \n| 4.  | Transfer page | [Link](https://github.com/TheDotflow/dotflow-ui/blob/main/src/pages/transfer.tsx) | The frontend code | \n\n**Additional Information**\n\nIn the very near future we plan to deploy the contract to a Kusama network parachain.\n",

Our Substrate chain utilises offchain workers to synchronize the state of connected bank accounts with their on-chain state. Thus it creates a token that is pegged by a bank account currency. Currently, our chain supports EURO and our token is called pEURO, or simply *pegged euro*. With the use of our chain users can easily on and off ramp to web3. For example, just with signing and submitting an extrinsic call, user can easily transfer their EUROs from their bank account to another bank account. And respectively, can mint *pEUROs* by simply depositing to their bank account.\n\n**Deliverables**\n> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository.

Documentation on how to build, test and launch Substrate chain and a separate instruction on testing minting, burning is also [provided](https://github.com/element36-io/ocw-ebics/blob/milestone-2/INSTRUCTIONS.md)|\n| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions of the basic token and the off chain worker is fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. Instructions to run the tests are provided. |\n| 1. | Off chain worker pallet: Event Processing | An [offchain worker pallet](https://github.com/element36-io/ocw-ebics/blob/milestone-2/pallets/fiat-ramps/src/lib.rs) is implemented that performs two main activities: a) polls the bank account for bank statements. Bank statement contains IBAN number, and list of incoming and outgoing transactions. For incoming transactions, pallet mints `amount` of tokens if `source` IBAN of the transaction is not registered on chain, transfers from `source` if it is registered. For outgoing transactions, burns if `destination` IBAN is not registered on chain, performs simple transfer otherwise. b) stores and processes burn requests. Burn request is created when user wants to initiate transfer or burn action on their bank account via on-chain extrinsic with their registered account. Burn requests are stored until they are processed by the offchain worker and removed after that. They will be removed even if `unpegging`/`burning` action fails. More explanation of offchain worker is provided in README file of the repository |\n| 2. | Balances Pallet: FIAT stable coin | Balances pallet is loosely coupled into our pallet that makes it possible to have the most basic token actions: mint, burn, transfer, etc. Our token has 10 decimals and has a name pEURO (pegged EURO). Total supply for testing purposes is 40000 pEUROs. |\n| 3. | Substrate chain | Altogether, we have a solo Substrate chain that connects to the banking APIs via offchain worker and makes sure to synchronize bank accounts' state with on-chain state. |\n| 4. | Unit Tests | Unit tests cover the most essential features of our offchain worker pallet. Every extrinsic, offchain worker behaviour and parsing of raw string into pallet types are thoroughly [tested](https://github.com/element36-io/ocw-ebics/blob/milestone-2/pallets/fiat-ramps/src/tests.rs)|\n| 5. | Docker-Compose Substrate node | A docker-compose file is provided to spawn the banking interface API developed in the Milestone 1. |\n\n**Additional Information**\n> Any further comments on the milestone that you would like to share with us.\n\nThere have been some changes from the initial grant proposal. They are:\n\n- `Minting`: minting process is not proactive, i.e it's not possible to call an extrinsic to mint new stablecoins. Stablecoins are minted only when offchain worker detects an incoming transaction from an unknown IBAN address, i.e from an IBAN address is not mapped to any on-chain account address.\n- `Burning`: unlike minting, burning can be achieved either via extrinsic or banking API. However, `burn` extrinsic is not an instant call, pallet will first register the burn request from the user and passes it to offchain worker to process the burn request. Offchain worker then sends the `unpeg` request to the banking API. And once the request suceeds, it will be reflected in the statement as an outgoing transaction, which in turn should be picked up by offchain worker again and processed accordingly.\n- Currently, it is not possible to run backend service with machines on Apple M1 Silicone chips. Therefore, for testing purposes you would need to use our hosted version of the backend.\n- There is an offchain worker keypair inserted into the keystore so that offchain worker can sign and submit transactions. Since it needs funds for transactions, it comes endowed with 10k pEURO balance.\n",

The demo application is a simple web application that allows users to register their bank accounts and perform basic token actions such as minting, burning and transferring. The demo application is a proof of concept that shows how the Substrate chain can be used to build a FIAT on-off ramp. \n\nDemo app is a React application that uses [Polkadot JS API](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/) to interact with the Substrate chain.\n\n**Deliverables**\n> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself.

Users can donate by either sending stablecoins or fiat to the recipient's on-chain account or bank account (IBAN). The recipient can then withdraw the funds to their bank account or send them to someone else. |\n| 2. | Docker-Compose: node & Dapp | Instead of `docker-compose` a [Makefile](https://github.com/element36-io/ocw-ebics/blob/main/Makefile) is provided with the commands that launch the chain and the demo app |\n\n**Additional Information**\n> Any further comments on the milestone that you would like to share with us.\nAll previously completed deliverables can be tested the same way as described in the older milestone. Specifically, unit tests and coverage. We also added linting with `clippy`.\n\nThere have been one significant change to the project. Along with the demo app, to provide a better context to the project we were working on a draft [whitepaper](https://github.com/element36-io/ocw-ebics/blob/main/docs/hyperfridge-draft.pdf) for our project “HyperFridge” which builds right on top of our delivery. In the initial funding request we noted that an attack vector would be the (ISO20022) API based backend which is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attack or just to a fake backend, which we are actually using in our demo environment. The paper describes how this can be mitigated by zero knowledge proofs which leverage on the signatures of the banks, which are included in each transaction message coming from the banking backend. With HyperFridge, we cryptographically prove transaction data (and balances) of the banking ledger.  Hence a bank account (its transactions) can be treated like a blockchain ledger in terms of trust. If this would work, we are able to fully mirror a bank ledger data  on-chain, thus reducing the problem with “asymmetric information” between blockchain and banking ledgers. This allows us to create zero-trust decentralized Fiat bridges which also work across multiple chains consistently - proof of assets for stable coins and payment systems are  the most obvious use cases.  \n\nWe also would like to note that we are very grateful for your support and understanding during the last months. We had to deal with some personal issues and we are very happy that we were able to deliver the project. We are looking forward to continue working on the project and we are very excited about the future of the Web3 Foundation and the Polkadot ecosystem.\n",

We will achieve this by introducing a PermissionResolver trait. Only for the purpose of this milestone there are going to be two trivial implantations of this trait. First configuration will grant the validator permissions and the second one will not. At this stage we only want to verify if hardcoded conditional logic works well with the nodes with the same auth key but different configurations (permission granted/denied). For the testing purpose we will provide an additional option to the CLI, to run a validator with one of the pointed configurations.\n\n\n\n**Deliverables**\n\nMilestone 1 is deliveried under the [milestone-1](https://github.com/bright/substrate-raft/tree/milestone-1) branch in our repository.\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Testing | Notes \n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| **0a.** | License | License can be found under: [substrate-raft](https://github.com/bright/substrate-raft/blob/milestone-1/LICENSE-GPL3)| Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / MIT / Unlicense | |\n| **0b.** | Documentation | | We will provide inline documentation.|\n| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide | Run `cargo test` in project’s root directory. | We will provide unit tests and the guidelines for running and testing it the scope. |\n| **0d.** | Docker | First run `bash docker/build.sh` in the project's root directory | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |\n| 1. | Update substrate | In `docker-compose.yml`, we have setup Alice-1 with permission granted to produce blocks/votes for finalised blocks and `I'm online` messages. Alice-2 is setup with permission deny. By running `docker-compose up`, we can observe that only Alice-1 is producing/finalising bloks and sending `I'm online` messages.   | Modify the substrate code to conditionally submit blocks/votes for finalised blocks (GRANDPA)/`I'm online` messages. |\n| 2. | Update substrate client - cli | We can run node with the `--permission-resolver=never` / `--permission-resolver=always` option, which will prevent / allows block production / vote finalisation and sending `I'm online` messages. | Modify the substrate code to conditionally grant or permit permissions. There will be option to run node in permission granted or permission denied mode). It will be useful to prove that permissioning works by running two nodes with same auth keys but different modes (permission granted/denied) |\n| 3. | Integration test | Run `bash docker/build.sh` and `docker-compose up`| A dockerised setup that allows to run network in setup described above. |\n",

This engagement helps to ensure that the ontological framework is grounded in real-world experience and reflects the current understanding of representative personas in the applied fields. In this sense, a key step of the proposed approach is to present and discuss the ontology with the Polkadot team.\n\n**Deliverables**\n> We wrote an article reporting the scientific findings regarding the proposed conceptual framework that includes a domain ontology called POnto (a Polkadot Ontology). POnto provides a structured representation of the ecosystem's concepts and relationships, enabling a formal understanding of the platform. The proposed knowledge-oriented approach enhances integration and communicability, enabling a wider range of users to participate in the ecosystem and facilitating the development of AI-based applications.\n\n\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| 0a. | License |[License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)|Creative Commons BY-SA| \n| 0b. | Documentation/Tutorial |[CollabSession](https://github.com/mobr-ai/POnto/raw/main/deliverables/milestone3/collabsession_reflections.pdf) [Article](https://github.com/mobr-ai/POnto/raw/main/deliverables/milestone3/article.pdf)| Collaborative Session and Reflections Scientific and Technical Findings | \n| 0c. | Methodology |[Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/mobrsys8246/m/mobrsys8246/1687177222066/0657ff82c759a1e630298bfe0bef6f839249ced7?sender=uaffae0538327c8810b801518) [Questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdc6twdciTH9hF-dKiNsv5oCWoIZwbyqwuFqKNB5sPq_AA6ww/viewform?usp=pp_url) [Article](https://github.com/mobr-ai/POnto/raw/main/deliverables/milestone3/article.pdf)| Methodology: see Section IV of the Article describing the Methodology |\n| 0d. | Infrastructure |[TR](https://github.com/mobr-ai/POnto/raw/main/deliverables/milestone3/infrastructure.pdf)|Technical Report presenting the infrastructure requirements|\n| 0e. | Article |[Article](https://github.com/mobr-ai/POnto/raw/main/deliverables/milestone3/article.pdf)|Full article detailing scientific and technical findings achieved in the project| \n| 1. | Presentation Deck |[Deck](https://github.com/mobr-ai/POnto/raw/main/deliverables/milestone3/collabsession_reflections.pdf)|Slide deck with reflections over the discussed content and action items|\n\n**Additional Information**\n> This is the last milestone in the current research grant.

[Nolik](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/Nolik.md)\n* **Milestone Number:** 2\n\n**Context**\n\nThis is the last milestone deliverable of a Nolik CLI app. \nThe app fully covers the functionality described in the grant application.\nIt allows sending data from one client to another without a third party.\nIn addition to the text form of data, the app enables sending files like photos and videos.\n\n\n**Deliverables**\n\nDuring the first milestone, I developed the FRAME pallet, which allows managing a Whitelist and a Blocklist of recipients.\nThe CLI app has that functionality built-in.\nIt will enable us to have a decentralised media platform, which I [described as an example](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/Nolik.md#use-case-example) in the grant application.\n\nThe app allows to:\n* Generate Wallets and Accounts (addresses)\n* Get free coins from Alice's Keyring account\n* Compose messages with key-value text data and attached files\n* Send a message to one or several recipients at the same time\n* Manage Whitelist and Blacklist of addresses\n* Receive encrypted messages and decrypt them on the client side\n\nI also added an [extra validation](https://github.com/chainify/pallet-nolik/blob/5150d3d045e4b0ed33c636ff74a764fc42bed4eb/src/lib.rs#L235) for the Nolik-pallet that allows to validate the uniqueness of the message, and [covered](https://github.com/chainify/pallet-nolik/blob/5150d3d045e4b0ed33c636ff74a764fc42bed4eb/src/tests.rs#L464) it with unit-tests.\n\n\n| Number | Deliverable   | Link

the app, but it totally worth it.\nDuring the grant I have significantly improved my Rust skills.\nI also struggled with sending data through a Substrate node using the node APIs.\nFortunately, with the help of Substrate community I've found answers to my questions (\n    [#1](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/1393/getting-extrinsic-data-with-the-transaction-hash),\n    [#2](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/975/generating-an-extrinsic-call-for-a-custom-pallet),\n

[#4](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/2656/decoding-events-with-rust)\n).\nThat helped me understand much better how Substrate node works on a low level.\n\n",

The main [README.md](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout/blob/web3-v2/README.md) in our repository also provides links to this webpage. |\n| 0c. | Testing | https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout/tree/web3-v2/apps/cargo-scout-audit/tests | We provide [integration testing](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout/tree/web3-v2/apps/cargo-scout-audit/tests). Specific tests for every linting detector based on [code examples and snippets of smart contracts](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout/tree/web3-v2/test-cases).  |\n| 0d. | Docker | - | Does not apply at this stage.  |\n| 0e. | Article | https://blog.coinfabrik.com/bigger-better-and-faster-vulnerability-detection-in-ink | We uploaded to our blog a report summary. |\n| 1.a | Research and Development | https://coinfabrik.github.io/scout/docs/vulnerabilities | Vulnerability examples. In addition to the [examples developed in the previous project of ScoutCoinFabrik PoC](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/ScoutCoinFabrik.md#milestone-1-proof-of-concept), we  developed more code examples and snippets of vulnerabilities, best practices, and enhancements related to smart contracts written in ink!. |\n| 1.b | Research and Development | https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout/tree/web3-v2/test-cases | We developed further example versions of [vulnerabilities developed in the previous project of ScoutCoinFabrik PoC](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/web3-grant/tree/main/vulnerabilities). These example versions are the new test-cases developed for the vulnerability classes [integer-overflow-or-underflow](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout/tree/web3-v2/test-cases/integer-overflow-or-underflow), [reentrancy](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout/tree/web3-v2/test-cases/reentrancy) and [unused-return-enum](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout/tree/web3-v2/test-cases/unused-return-enum). |\n| 2.a | Development | https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout/tree/web3-v2 | We built a prototype that improves over the [development of the previous project of ScoutCoinFabrik PoC](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/ScoutCoinFabrik.md#milestone-1-proof-of-concept), detecting more [classes of vulnerabilities](https://coinfabrik.github.io/scout/docs/vulnerabilities#vulnerability-classes) and improving in precision on existing detectors. This prototype can analyze Rust code to detect vulnerabilities in ink! smart contracts and possibly in pallets and other pieces of code. This builds over [this proof-of-concept tool](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/web3-grant) we've built and [delivered as part of a grant for the web3 foundation](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/ScoutCoinFabrik-1.md) by: <br> a) Moving from a proof-of-concept (PoC) tool to a robust tool that integrates with a popular IDE (VSCode), includes a CLI, etc, <br> b) We improved on the precision of the detectors we included in the PoC reducing the rate of false positives, and  <br> c) We [added more detectors](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout/tree/web3-v2/detectors) in order to have a reasonable coverage of the relevant security vulnerabilities that happen in smart contracts. |\n| 2.b | Development | https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout/tree/web3-v2/apps/cargo-scout-audit | We built a command line interface for the prototype. We developed a simple command line interface like the one used in other static analyzers from other blockchains (eg: [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither), [Rustle](https://github.com/blocksecteam/rustle)). <br> In particular, we developed the possibility to run the prototype on smart contract files or directories. <br> The base command is: `cargo scout-audit` <br> We also [included options](https://coinfabrik.github.io/scout/docs/intro#usage) for running subsets of detectors. | |\n| 2.c | Development | https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoinFabrik.scout-audit | We provide VSCode integration for the prototype. Our VSCode development lists security issues, highlights issues with squiggles and hover-over descriptions. This development is compatible with other relevant ink! extensions such as [Ink! Analyzer](https://w3f.github.io/Grants-Program/applications/ink-analyzer#future-plans).  |\n| 3 | Evaluation | https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout/blob/web3-v2/assets/false-positives-report.md | We performed prototype validation against a selection of projects deployed on testnet or mainnet in order to evaluate detector precision. We provide an evaluation report and detector improvement. |\n \n\n**Additional Information**\n\nOur original plan was to apply for a 3 milestones grant, to reach a public release of the tool. But we were advised to apply for a shorter objective. After completing the PoC in our first stage, we have now completed this second stage to reach a tool prototype. We envison a third stage together with a public release. Our mission is to continue to work on improving automated and assisted tools for finding security vulnerabilities and writing more secure code. Our objective is to help the Polkadot / Kusama community produce better and more secure code with these tools.\n\nRichard Casey from Parity brought this program to our attention. Our inquiries were addressed by David Hawig and Bhargav Bhatt, who also kindly advised us on this presentation.\n\nFind our project's repo at: https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout\n",

The project was initially named \"Stylograph,\" but has been renamed to `pallet_hookpoints` to align with traditional Substrate naming conventions. The frontend part is also fully completed. A detailed walkthrough of the development process and features is documented in a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@GenesisDAO/introducing-the-hookpoints-pallet-377de6680c2d).\n\nIf you want to try it out, Genesis DAO has its own testnet:\n- [The frontend](https://www.genesis-dao.org/)\n- [The backend service](https://service.genesis-dao.org/redoc/)\n- [The node](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fnode.genesis-dao.org#/)\n\n> Note: This is a testnet. It does not have real tokens, the alice/bob test accounts are available for free use, and we are resetting this testnet regularly. Do not use for production use cases and do not expect data to remain.\n\nIf you want to build from source, note that we upgraded to polkadot-1.0.0. And (similar to the frame pallets) you should link `pallet_hookpoints` from GitHub like this: https://github.com/deep-ink-ventures/genesis-dao-node/blob/main/pallets/dao-votes/Cargo.toml#L26\n\nNote that Genesis DAO now has a Cumulus/parachain integration, so compiling no longer yields a `genesis-dao` binary but a `genesis-dao-solochain` binary. This is the one used in our testnet.\n\n## Milestone 1 Deliverables\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------ | ----------- | ---- | ----- |\n| 0a.    | License | [GitHub License](https://github.com/deep-ink-ventures/pallet_hookpoints/blob/main/LICENSE) | Apache 2.0 license for `pallet_hookpoints` |\n| 0b.    | Documentation | [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@GenesisDAO/introducing-the-hookpoints-pallet-377de6680c2d), [README](https://github.com/deep-ink-ventures/pallet_hookpoints/blob/main/README.md) | Exhaustive inline documentation and basic tutorial provided.

We are actively adding new features to both.\n- We are actively integrating `pallet_hookpoints` into Genesis DAO. An example of its usage is the planned integration of vesting wallets, which will be respected by the votes hookpoint. More details can be found in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/deep-ink-ventures/genesis-dao-node/issues/117).\n- A detailed walkthrough has been provided through a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@GenesisDAO/introducing-the-hookpoints-pallet-377de6680c2d).\n- The frontend part is fully completed\n",

A user can, by default, query identities from Polkadot, Kusama or Westend. After a search is done, a list view with all results is displayed. An identity can be selected from the list by clicking on the table row. This is to present its details in an identity view. The SubIdentity web application uses the SubIdentity npm package to search for identities on a given node.

Our goal is to bridge the gap between technical intricacies and user-friendly visualization, empowering individuals to make informed decisions about blockchain adoption, investment, and development.\n\nThe project consists of two main parts:\n\n1. ETL System\n2. User Interface (UI) with Data Visualizations\n\nThis milestone contains the ETL System according to the original [TPScore grant application](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/TPScore.md).\n\n**Deliverables**\n\nAfter submission of this milestone all changes to the repo will happen outside of 'main' branch.\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| **0a.** | License |[Licence](https://github.com/BCS-Labs/tpscore-etl-system/blob/main/LICENSE)| GPLv3|\n| **0b.** | Documentation |[Documentation](https://github.com/BCS-Labs/tpscore-etl-system/blob/main/README.md)| We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial**.\n| **0c.** | Tests and Testing Guide |[Tests](https://github.com/BCS-Labs/tpscore-etl-system/blob/main/airflow/dags/test_get_data_tpscore.py), [Testing Guide](https://github.com/BCS-Labs/tpscore-etl-system/tree/main#testing-guide)| Core functions will be fully covered by comprehensive unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness.

A new field, 'processing_started_at,' was added to the 'tps' table. It was needed to group batches of received data. Additionally, the 'processing_started_at' field, in conjunction with the existing 'chain_name,' now serves as the primary identifier for the 'tps' table.\n\n2. We needed to exclude the 'OAK Network' from our project scope due to the lack of a Polkadot parachain.\n",

This github repository contains the docker file to test all functionality for this milestone: https://github.com/tellor-io/tellor-parachain-contracts/tree/7f8cf44f526d0c42fd35074024f2daa40c637579\n\nThe implementation is very similar to the structure Tellor uses on other chains. The security of the oracle comes through a deposit of a token that acts as a bond or stake (note that stake and bond are used interchangebly) requirement in order for reporters to participate in providing data. The reporters risk losing this stake if they submit data that is successfully disputed. Anyone can become a reporter and push data on-chain and anyone can dispute the data for a fee. This is how Tellor is both crypto-economically secure and permissionless. \n\nThe Tellor protocol is split in two parts: 1)The staking and governance which will live on an EVM compatible parachain and 2)the Tellor Pallet that can be implemented by any parachain. Milestone 1 focuses on the side of Tellor that will be deployed to an EVM compatible parachain. This is composed of four contracts that allow data reporters to stake (or put up a bond on-chain), for disputes to be resolved and to communicate with the consumer parachain(any parachain that implements the Tellor pallet) via XCM:  ParachainStaking, ParachainGovernance, Parachain, ParachainRegistry. \n\n* ParachanStaking - contains all the functionality for reporters to deposit their bond, withdraw their bond and allow the governace contract to put the reporter’s stake on escrow while a dispute resolves. \n* ParachainGovernance – this contract has the logic for receiving disputes from the consumer parachain and collecting vote outcomes and allowing for the dispute resolution. \n* ParachainRegistry – allows for parachains to register so they can interact with the Tellor staking and goverance mechanisms.\n* Parachain contains – the XCM messaging functionality.\n\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| **0a.** | License |  https://github.com/tellor-io/tellor-parachain-contracts/blob/7f8cf44f526d0c42fd35074024f2daa40c637579/LICENSE |\n| **0b.** | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial**.

Visiting the Whiteflag tab on our main interface will show an example of encode/decode in action. |\n\n\n**Additional Information**\nThe scope of this milestone expanded somewhat to include improved integration for our message and identity management system. This component, fennel-api, cooperates with our blockchain to act as a sort of cache layer for identities, and a more secure HTTPS-compatible interface for message exchange.\n\nWork from our last grant is included in the links provided in this submission. This is for full reference on all cooperating features, as most of our repositories were modified in some way to adjust for new architecture decisions.",

This will be published after the milestone is accepted. |\n| 1. | Implementation of Whiteflag Protocol | https://github.com/fennelLabs/whiteflag-rust | Our Rust port of the Whiteflag protocol is now in an early alpha state, supporting all major message types and cryptography for on-chain messages. |\n| 2. | Whiteflag Integration - fennel-cli | https://github.com/fennelLabs/fennel-cli/blob/60128a34a3a1a68cc4ba2f541e8f5d75fdc2eda9/src/fennel_rpc/mod.rs#L143 | The original fennel-cli RPC has been updated to add full support for the Whiteflag protocol through the two functions listed in the referenced file. These functions will take Whiteflag messages as JSON and format them correctly for submission to the chain. |\n| 3. | IPFS Support | https://github.com/fennelLabs/fennel-lib/blob/master/src/ipfs/mod.rs, https://github.com/fennelLabs/fennel-app/commit/37cc301f03ebd7eef83b589385fe566bfa777aa2#diff-299b25d6371add360dcaf87c6a21570765a9f5af351dfd10bb9ccaba5d5c8b6a | Basic IPFS support is now baked in to fennel-cli, with more complete interface-wrapped support in fennel-app. The easiest way to explore this is through the IPFS interface in fennel-app, just make sure you use either our Docker Compose setup with an IPFS node or run IPFS Desktop locally. |\n\n\n**Additional Information**\nWork from our last grant is included in the links provided in this submission. This is for full reference on all cooperating features, as most of our repositories were modified in some way to adjust for new architecture decisions.",

There is no need to build each project by hand. It's enough to run following commands to have the deps installed and built:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/anagolay/anagolay-js-sdk.git\ncd anagolay-js-sdk\n\n# install the deps\nnode common/scripts/install-run-rush.js update\n\n# build the sdk libraries\nnode common/scripts/install-run-rush.js build\n```\n\n**Web app**\n\nStart the app:\n\n```bash\ncd app\npnpm dev\n```\n\nNow go to [http://localhost:7766](http://localhost:7766).\n\n> Note that anagolay JS sdk repo is fully enabled to use gitpod.\n\n**Extension**\n\nBuild the app:\n\n> Note that the build process will produce warnings, they are not breaking nor have any effect on the performance of the Extension. All of them come from Polkadot Api libraries, due to the `sideEffects` and types lookup.\n\n```bash\ncd extension\npnpm build\n```\n\nAfter you build it you should follow [tutorial](https://anagolay.dev/blog/chrome_extension_wallet/installation-and-step-by-step-tutorial/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=w3f_deliverable&utm_campaign=gp_1224) to learn how to install the extension in a browser of your choice. This tutorial includes the video tutorials as well.\n",

We had technical dificulties implementing a general `Tuples` encoder/decoder due to AssemblyScript limitations (AS does not support reflection and `tuples`). After consulting with the AssemblyScript Dev team, we've decided to mitigate the task by not implementing a general `Tuples` encoder/decoder, but rather implement the concrete Objects (`Block`, `Extrinsic` etc..).

Valid blocks authored in future slots contain the corresponding secret keys. The initial version of our network uses a fork of Aura to implement a PoA version of EtF.  \n\nThe work presented below represents the outcome of development of our first milestone where we lay the foundations for the network by modifying Substrate’s Aura consensus mechanism to enable a hybrid PoA/Proof-of-knowledge consensus. \n\n**Deliverables**\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| -----: | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| **0a.** | License | https://github.com/ideal-lab5/substrate/blob/milestone1/LICENSE-GPL3, [etf-pallet](https://github.com/ideal-lab5/substrate/blob/e1b7e7bbbcdb3131edb0c635cec30dfcbe1012eb/bin/node-template/pallets/etf/Cargo.toml#L8) | GPLv3 | \n| **0b.** | Documentation | https://ideal-lab5.github.io | also see inline documentation |\n| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XfBpWfTUq-8DYJ43ZqJGpXb_AJMEvK6PV01nEn8JwQo/edit?usp=sharing |  |\n| **0d.** | Docker | https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ideallabs/etf/general | |\n| **0e.** | Article | https://ideallabs.substack.com/p/e6bb13fb-be93-4a22-b039-f81b7c70e93c | It isn't published yet.

Instead we are able to just calculate these on the fly, and make them publicly calculable as well. This is explained in the docs with how we derive the public key for a slot id, which occurs when blocks are proposed and imported. The first link shows how identities are derived, the second link is to the hash-to-g1 function we use to hash slot ids to a point in G1. |\n| **3.** | Substrate module: Aura Client | https://github.com/ideal-lab5/substrate/tree/milestone1/client/consensus/aura/src| See the attached article link and documentation for more insights on how this piece works.

Since we're using a PoA consensus, validator incentives are really simple: blocks with invalid slot secrets are rejected and the network fails to produce more blocks. At the beginning each session, each validator is awarded 10 tokens. Note that we see the PoA version as a stepping stone, and intend to integrate with Sassafrass + Babe.  |\n\n\n**Additional Information**\n",

It uses a slot-based consensus system as a reference clock to which messages can be encrypted. The initial implementation uses a fork of Aura to implement a proof-of-authority version of ETF, where authorities are IBE master key custodians. Valid blocks authored in future slots contain the corresponding secret keys. To put it another way, each slot has a unique, publicly calculable identity, and whenever a block is authored in that slot, the identity owners leaks their secret key.\n\nIn the 2nd milestone we deliver tools requried to perform timelock encryption on the network. Additionally, we deliver a typescript library and custom smoldot/substrate-connect fork to easily integrate into a user interface.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| -----: | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| **0a.** | License | https://github.com/ideal-lab5/substrate/blob/etf/LICENSE-GPL3 | GPLv3 | \n| **0b.** | Documentation | https://ideal-lab5.github.io | also see inline documentation |\n| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wyWSHl-MJtiaFzuZqsPTAq0ABRCw9RlxIjt5m6pEOUY/edit?usp=sharing  |  |\n| **0d.** | Docker | https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ideallabs/etf/general | |\n| **0e.** | Article | https://ideallabs.substack.com/p/e1d2e89b-ec19-477d-8781-7401fc3efbbe | unpublished, pending milestone 2 acceptance. |\n| 1. | Light Client | [smoldot fork](https://github.com/ideal-lab5/smoldot/tree/etf), [substrate-connect fork](https://github.com/ideal-lab5/substrate-connect/tree/etf) |  |\n| 2 | User Interface: setup | [the UI](https://github.com/ideal-lab5/etf.js/tree/main/examples) | A guide on running and testing the interface can be found in the testing document.

Users earn interest from exchange fees through the LP token's exchange rate appreciation when LP tokens increases in value relative to underlying assets. |\n| 5. | The code will have complete unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness. | https://github.com/equilibrium-eosdt/equilibrium-curve-amm/blob/32c12fb4dbe8227da5e29a457ee28c6f02cfe4d5/pallets/equilibrium-curve-amm/src/tests.rs |  |\n| 6. | We will publish the code in the Equilibrium’s public GitHub repository. | https://github.com/equilibrium-eosdt/equilibrium-curve-amm |  |\n| 7. | We will provide detailed technical documentation describing pallet logic, storage, interfaces, subscriptions. | https://github.com/equilibrium-eosdt/equilibrium-curve-amm/blob/32c12fb4dbe8227da5e29a457ee28c6f02cfe4d5/pallets/equilibrium-curve-amm/src/lib.rs | See rustocs and comments throughout entire file. |\n\n\n",

Verifier Service (previously named Metadata Registry in the grant application). The main functions of the service are to:\n- verify ink! smart contract source code through reproducible builds\n- store and serve verified contract source code\n- generate, store and serve verified contract metadata\n- expose an intuitive web API for easy integration into any application that wishes to use the above functionalities\n\nIn this same milestone we also deliver the updated Epirus Substrate Explorer UI which integrates with the ink! Verifier Service. The UI provides a user-friendly interface for uploading source code, following the verification process through streamed logs and displaying of verified source code.\n\nThere are three project repositories that make up this delivery:\n- **[ink! Verifier Server:](https://github.com/web3labs/ink-verifier-server)** The main project repository for this delivery. The server manages the verification process and serves the web API.\n- **[ink! Verifier Image:](https://github.com/web3labs/ink-verifier-image)** The docker image that the ink! Verifier Server uses to ensure identical build environments for reproducible builds. The repository also houses the command line tool for generating verifiable contract packages.\n- **[Explorer UI:](https://github.com/web3labs/epirus-substrate/tree/main/explorer-ui)** The UI of the contracts explorer.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| 0a. | License | Server: https://github.com/web3labs/ink-verifier-server/blob/main/LICENSE <br /> Image: https://github.com/web3labs/ink-verifier-image/blob/main/LICENSE <br /> UI: https://github.com/web3labs/epirus-substrate/blob/main/LICENSE | Apache 2.0 | \n| 0b. | Documentation | Server: https://github.com/web3labs/ink-verifier-server/blob/main/README.md <br /> Image: https://github.com/web3labs/ink-verifier-image/blob/main/README.md <br /> Tutorial: https://github.com/web3labs/ink-verifier-server/blob/main/docs/TUTORIAL.md | The project READMEs + tutorial contains or points to all the information needed for development, deployment and testing. |\n| 0c. | Testing Guide | Server unit tests: https://github.com/web3labs/ink-verifier-server/blob/main/README.md#testing <br /> UI unit tests: https://github.com/web3labs/epirus-substrate/blob/main/explorer-ui/README.md#testing |  | \n| 0d. | Docker | ink!

An example contract with verified source code can be seen [here](https://substrate.sirato.xyz/codes/0x2ed87234d3c1a2dd23ca67d49cc8cc8454aabefff6fffeb495bba27a75d38ecc/sources). |\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nIn this delivery we also added the option to upload only the metadata of the contract if it is signed by the owner. This feature is added in anticipation of the next milestone: decoding contract messages and events. This was not included in the grant application but we deemed it a useful feature since the process of source code verification is still experimental and subject to change (works only with cargo-contract ^v2.0.0-alpha.5 and ink! ^v4.0.0-alpha.3). You can find more information about this feature in the ink! verifier server [documentation](https://github.com/web3labs/ink-verifier-server/blob/main/README.md#unverified-metadata-upload).\n",

We have not implemented point 2. of the bidding pallet --> \"If a share of the contribution is taken out the user will drop in the ranking (points ranking).\" We kept the bidding pallet algorithm simple. The bidding pallet does what it is supposed to do, this rule is not necessary for the bidding pallet to work and would add a lot of complexity while we are not sure if such a feature would be used. We will implement this or something similar in the future if we see a need for it. We think the bidding pallet selection of allocations could be further optimized and that is where would like to focus our efforts in the future.\n2. We have a new [contributor](https://github.com/cuteolaf) to the repo, he will join from M4 on. His past contributions have no impact on the deliverables of M3. We are not planning to change the grant proposal with an updated team, but if needed we can do so.\n3. **Module: Timer** mentioned in the [application](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/fair_squares.md#milestone-3---bidding-mechanism) has been replaced by the [frame_support::traits::Hooks](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/frame_support/traits/trait.Hooks.html#method.on_finalize) where we defined that after every epoch (5 min) we will have scan for status changes in the assets and are looking for specific status that triggers the bidding-pallet to take action.

We created Substrate Node that contains Pallet Assets (for creating assets), Pallet Scheduler (for scheduling polls endings), and main Pallet Faterium Polls.\n\nTo minimize storage on chain - we created a Golang server that embedded IPFS node and PocketBase, to create the best User Experience and make it possible to store big media files as IPFS CID in database. To make it simple and straightforward to test - we launched a test Substrate Network on our servers, created simple interface pages for creating Polls, and voting on them (with help of polkadot{.js} extension).\n\nIn the next `Milestone 2` - we will create all remaining pages, improve UI, and add community management logic.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| -----: | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| 0a. | License | https://github.com/faterium/faterium-node/blob/v0.1.1/LICENSE https://github.com/faterium/faterium-server/blob/v0.1.1/LICENSE https://github.com/faterium/faterium-dapp/blob/v0.1.1/LICENSE | Apache License 2.0 |\n| 0b. | Documentation | https://github.com/faterium/faterium-node/tree/v0.1.1/pallets/faterium-polls | [faterium-node/README](https://github.com/faterium/faterium-node/tree/v0.1.1/pallets/faterium-polls), [faterium-node/lib.rs](https://github.com/faterium/faterium-node/blob/v0.1.1/pallets/faterium-polls/src/lib.rs), [faterium-server/README](https://github.com/faterium/faterium-server/tree/v0.1.1/), [faterium-dapp/README](https://github.com/faterium/faterium-dapp/tree/v0.1.1/) |\n| 0c. | Testing Guide | https://github.com/faterium/faterium-node/tree/v0.1.1/#test | Documentation on how to run Substrate tests for Faterium Node. |\n| 0d. | Docker | [Faterium Node Dockerfile](https://github.com/faterium/faterium-node/blob/v0.1.1/.github/docker/Dockerfile), [Faterium Server Dockerfile](https://github.com/faterium/faterium-server/blob/v0.1.1/Dockerfile), [Local Services docker-compose](https://github.com/faterium/faterium-server/blob/v0.1.1/infra/local/docker-compose.yml), [Testnet Server docker-compose](https://github.com/faterium/faterium-server/blob/v0.1.1/infra/testnet/docker-compose.yml) | Dockerfiles for server and node, docker-compose file for server that launches all services: proxy, polkadot-apps, faterium-server, faterium-node. |\n| 1. | Crowdfunding Polls Pallet | https://github.com/faterium/faterium-node/tree/v0.1.1/pallets/faterium-polls | We created Faterium Polls pallet with detailed documentation, full test coverage, and all necessary logic. |\n| 2. | Configure Substrate Node | https://github.com/faterium/faterium-node/tree/v0.1.1/ | We created Faterium Node with help of Substrate, Assets pallet, Scheduler pallet, and Faterium Polls pallet. |\n| 3. | Faterium Server with PocketBase and IPFS | https://github.com/faterium/faterium-server/tree/v0.1.1/ | We created Faterium Server with Golang, an IPFS node embedded in server, and PocketBase.

The Dapp in this milestone exists solely to demonstrate the functionality of the indexer. It will be further developed in milestones 2 and 3.\n\nThe indexer currently stores a partial representation of most events it indexes. When an event is found by a query, this representation is returned to the client in JSON. In milestone 2 the indexer will be updated to not store the event at all. Only block number and event index will be returned to the client. The client will then load the event via RPC or Substrate Connect. Because the event storing functionality is about to be removed, it does not have unit tests.\n\nIndexing is currently quite slow. Asynchronous block downloading will be implemented in milestone 2 to speed things up.\n\n",

We believe in the positive impact this project can bring on the Polkadot ecosystem.\n",

Each project had to have a dedicated ID\nThere is also [documentation](https://github.com/imbuenetwork/imbue) detailing how to add a project via Polkadot JS\n\nThe team has been mainly focused on getting the collator part done for both milestones as we felt that was the more difficult part. We are proud of what we have achieved given the time spent.\n\nThe only missing point is `0e` which is an article explaining how to go through the UI. We are planning to do this as soon as we complete the UI for voting/contributing as we feel it will make sense to our community\n\n\nHowever, that said the core functionality of creating a project, defining its milestones as well as contributing and having the funds unloked based on votes is complete\n\nWe also did a tremendous amount of work to make it seamless to launch the collator using docker/polkadot-js so every single member of our community can launch the entire chain with very little technical knowledge\n\n\nFinally, We have shared a demo of the full flow [here](https://imbuenetwork.medium.com/imbue-mvp-demo-33d6c3e29856)\n\n\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| 0a (milestone 2) | CI/CD |https://github.com/ImbueNetwork/imbue/blob/main/.github/workflows/collator_actions.yml| While this pipeline only ensures the code can be built, we will be expanding it to include deployment to an environment as soon the UI prototype is done |\n| 0a | licence | https://github.com/ImbueNetwork/imbue| License | \n| 0b  | DAPP |https://github.com/ImbueNetwork/prototype| The UI to allow you to submit proposals | \n| 0c  | Documentation | https://github.com/ImbueNetwork/imbue/blob/main/scripts/docker-compose.yml | The main repo has a guide on launching from source | \n| 0d  | Docker |https://github.com/ImbueNetwork/prototype | The main repo has a polkadot-launch docker-compose file to get the entire infrastructure up, including polkadotJS |\n| 1 | Grants Pallet | https://github.com/ImbueNetwork/imbue/blob/main/pallets/proposals/src/lib.rs#L187 | Renamed to proposals, has alot of the functionality required for milestone 2. |\n\n\n**Additional Information**\n> We also completed some of Milestone 2 points, we would like to submit milestone 1 as we are very keen on joining substrate builders programme and a successful milestone delivery will strongly help our application\n\nWe are now in a position where we are thinking how we can mint on statemint, and maybe use its stable currencies when it is available.\n\nWe also hope to work with the Web3 foundation and Parity - through the substrate builders programme - to get some guidance to how voting should work when working with stable currencies as well as when a round is considered successful. i.e. hitting 80% of required funding vs 120%\n\nWe also know we require to add tests as well as benchmarks, there is already a dedicated [ticket](https://sharing.clickup.com/v/4-54644340-2/t/h/1ufupfj/b653e1b55c26828) that's also part of the public board, which incidently is also part of milestone 2\n\nOverall, we have done alot of work towards the milestones and we reached a point where we could benefit with some guidance to ensure what we are building is what is best for the entire ecosystem\n",

This milestone delivery is mostly focused on the UI\n\n\nDuring the discussion in our original grant we highlighted the need to build a form of DAO framework, e.g. to allow contributors to give feedback on why they voted\n\nWe also want to build out a tendering alternative, to allow more Web2 business to submit briefs and allow the entire network to submit proposals and fund them safely knowing their funds will only be used once they are happy on the progress\n\nThis opens up a new market for us and brings in real value and utility that impacts people's lives.\n\nWe will be applying for a future grant if the web3 foundation agrees that this adds value to the ecosystem\n",

We abandon the integration with rust-ipfs which was used as part of the original iris proposal. There are several reasons to do this, but the main reason is that rust-ipfs is still under development and is not yet feature complete, which severely limits its capabilities and security. Additionally, integration with rust-ipfs by embedding it within the substrate runtime significantly increases development and maintenance overhead while the benefits do not outweight usage of an external ipfs instance with go-ipfs and http bindings/communication via offchain workers. As such, this milestone will introduce breaking changes to the data ejection and ingestion workflows which are addressed in milestone 2. The results of this change implies that data ingestion and ejection are temporarily non-functional, though the underlying mechanisms are untouched. That is, this milestone introduces mechanisms to organize asset classes using dataspaces and authorization mechanisms for accessing offchain data associated with asset classes, without actually delivering the offchain data.\n\n2. We introduce data spaces, the ability to manage data spaces associated with data, and lay the groundwork for future moderation capabilities.\n\n3. We deliver composable access rules, the rule executor, and the iris-ejection pallet to the Iris network, allowing data owners to specify unique business models that consumers must adhere to across any number of data spaces. Specifically, we will implement a composable access rule and associated rule executor contract which allows a token to be 'redeemed' only a limited number of times (e.g. ownership of a token implies you can fetch associated data only N times from the network).\n\n**Repositories**:\n\n* Iris node: https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris/tree/milestone_1\n* Contracts: https://github.com/ideal-lab5/contracts/tree/iris_milestone_1\n* User interface: https://github.com/ideal-lab5/ui\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| -- | -- | --| -- |\n| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 and GPL3, see [iris node repo](https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris/tree/milestone_1) and [contracts repo](https://github.com/ideal-lab5/contracts/tree/iris_milestone_1) | |\n| 0b. | Documentation | https://ideal-lab5.github.io/ | |\n| 0c. | Testing Guide | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XhBUSWp1lGhZbBVmFmre5ojEPlNCMccmFz-pvV2VypM/edit?usp=sharing | See the spreadsheet embedded in the testing guide for a detailed breakdown of scenarios and steps to execute them |\n| 0d. | Docker | Iris: Iris-UI: | | |\n| 0e. | Article | https://medium.com/ideal-labs/iris-milestone-1-update-fe9411ca6704 | | |\n| 1. | Separate Iris node from substrate runtime fork | https://github.com/driemworks/iris/tree/0752a546e315b47e80f96d3885398404130be1bd | The commits were squashed and merged, so this points to the repo at the initial commit, not the diff itself.

Additionally, tests were updated. |\n| 4. | Contracts | https://github.com/ideal-lab5/contracts/tree/iris_milestone_1/composable_access_rules | The top level README contains information on building and testing. |\n| 5. | Substrate Module: Iris-Ejection | pallet: https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris/tree/milestone_1/pallets/iris-ejection and chain extension: https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris/blob/9931ae51c4ecfdb972e65f4dce2698a3be028b75/runtime/src/lib.rs#L974| This introduces the module through which asset class ownership can associate rule executors with their assets and allows rule executors to submit execution results on chain. We also expose the functionality via an addition to our chain extension. |\n| 6. | Substrate Module: Iris-Session | https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris/tree/milestone_1/pallets/iris-session | The iris-session pallet was modified to read requests added to the DataRetrievalQueue as defined in the IrisEjection pallet. Further, we removed all references to the offchain::ipfs integration and have added http bindings (that are currently not in use until the next milestone) to communicate with go-ipfs. |\n| 7. | User Interface | https://github.com/ideal-lab5/ui | The user interface is very minimal and somewhat self explanatory. Error messages are minimal and though there is a specific flow which users must follow in order to interact with assets in iris (as elaborated in the testing guide), this user interface does not follow any specific worflow. Demo/walkthrough available on request. |\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nSee the testing guide.\n",

Additionally, Iris' authority nodes are capable of forming an IPFS network. \n\nNodes can add data to Iris which results in the creation of a new asset class. The admin of the asset class can then mint assets from the class and distribute them to beneficiaries, which is synonymous with provisioning access to other addresses. Nodes that own an asset can then access the underlying data associated with the asset class. Access to the data is made possible by invoking the RPC endpoint. When data is requested from the network, a unique OCW will process the request and store the desired data offchain, which is then retrieved via the RPC runtime api when the endpoint is invoked. \n\n**Deliverables**\n\nFor testing and verification purposes, I would recommend working from the HEAD of the branch specified in the notes section. Some names (e.g. of extrinsics and events), structs, and functionality was changed between deliverables, so running from individual commit hashes may not provide an accurate depiction of the overall milestone deliverables.\n\n**Pre-release**: https://github.com/iridium-labs/substrate/releases/tag/v0.0.1\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| 0a. | License | [Apache 2](https://github.com/iridium-labs/substrate/blob/master/LICENSE-APACHE2) | No change to licenses used in Substrate |\n| 0b. | Documentation | https://iridium-labs.github.io/ | The mdbook source is found at: https://github.com/iridium-labs/iris-docs |\n| 0c. | Testing Guide | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p_qy-Q2xbFa_rv394llIrTqRJIpRKn8RDRAdpjKTF2Y/edit?usp=sharing |  |\n| 0d. | Docker |  https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/iridiumlabs/iris https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/iridiumlabs/iris-ui |  |\n| 0e. | Article | https://medium.com/iridium/iris-a-next-gen-decentralized-storage-network-a53562c27de2 |  |\n| 0f. | Update offchain::ipfs to substrate V3 | commit hash: c198a480f542f7d01903ed675df23f8d700bcaa7 | https://github.com/iridium-labs/substrate/tree/iris_milestone_1 |\n| 1.  | Iris Pallet: Data Ingestion and Asset Class Creation | commit hash: e92945345e06251a5e36766495f1faeba2830cef | https://github.com/iridium-labs/substrate/tree/iris_milestone_1 |\n| 2.  | Iris Pallet: Asset Creation and Data Ejection | commit hash: f4fe66be89528c0ff0945773a17f500797ad38b5 | https://github.com/iridium-labs/substrate/tree/iris_milestone_1 |\n| 3.  | Iris Pallet: IPFS node connection between peers | commit hash: 7db6b3875748ce28edf457094d2be6dee0058027 | https://github.com/iridium-labs/substrate/tree/iris_milestone_1 |\n| 4.  | RPC endpoint | commit hash: 03f63578342366bdcc3bf0c8c4343b31241f001f | https://github.com/iridium-labs/substrate/tree/iris_milestone_1 |\n| 5.  | User Interface | https://github.com/iridium-labs/ui/tree/iris_milestone_1 | | \n\n**Additional Information**\n\n",

We abandon the integration with rust-ipfs which was used as part of the original iris proposal. There are several reasons to do this, but the main reason is that rust-ipfs is still under development and is not yet feature complete, which severely limits its capabilities and security. Additionally, integration with rust-ipfs by embedding it within the substrate runtime significantly increases development and maintenance overhead while the benefits do not outweight usage of an external ipfs instance with go-ipfs and http bindings/communication via offchain workers. As such, this milestone will introduce breaking changes to the data ejection and ingestion workflows which are addressed in milestone 2. The results of this change implies that data ingestion and ejection are temporarily non-functional, though the underlying mechanisms are untouched. That is, this milestone introduces mechanisms to organize asset classes using dataspaces and authorization mechanisms for accessing offchain data associated with asset classes, without actually delivering the offchain data.\n\n2. We introduce data spaces, the ability to manage data spaces associated with data, and lay the groundwork for future moderation capabilities.\n\n3. We deliver composable access rules, the rule executor, and the iris-ejection pallet to the Iris network, allowing data owners to specify unique business models that consumers must adhere to across any number of data spaces. Specifically, we will implement a composable access rule and associated rule executor contract which allows a token to be 'redeemed' only a limited number of times (e.g. ownership of a token implies you can fetch associated data only N times from the network).\n\n**Repositories**:\n\n* Iris node: https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris/tree/milestone_1\n* Contracts: https://github.com/ideal-lab5/contracts/tree/iris_milestone_1\n* User interface: https://github.com/ideal-lab5/ui\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| -- | -- | --| -- |\n| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 and GPL3, see [iris node repo](https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris/tree/milestone_1) and [contracts repo](https://github.com/ideal-lab5/contracts/tree/iris_milestone_1) | |\n| 0b. | Documentation | https://ideal-lab5.github.io/ | |\n| 0c. | Testing Guide | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XhBUSWp1lGhZbBVmFmre5ojEPlNCMccmFz-pvV2VypM/edit?usp=sharing | See the spreadsheet embedded in the testing guide for a detailed breakdown of scenarios and steps to execute them |\n| 0d. | Docker | Iris: Iris-UI: | | |\n| 0e. | Article | https://medium.com/ideal-labs/iris-milestone-1-update-fe9411ca6704 | | |\n| 1. | Separate Iris node from substrate runtime fork | https://github.com/driemworks/iris/tree/0752a546e315b47e80f96d3885398404130be1bd | The commits were squashed and merged, so this points to the repo at the initial commit, not the diff itself. This is the initial commit wherein we migrated from a full substrate fork to a substrate node only. |\n| 2. | Substrate Module: Data spaces | https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris/blob/milestone_1/pallets/data-spaces/src/lib.rs |  |\n| 3. | Substrate module: Iris-Assets | https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris/blob/milestone_1/pallets/iris-assets/src/lib.rs | Changes specific to this milestone are the introduction of dataspace specification [here](https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris/blob/9931ae51c4ecfdb972e65f4dce2698a3be028b75/pallets/iris-assets/src/lib.rs#L270) as well as the removal of the ability to pin data (as we removed the rust-ipfs integration). Additionally, tests were updated. |\n| 4. | Contracts | https://github.com/ideal-lab5/contracts/tree/iris_milestone_1/composable_access_rules | The top level README contains information on building and testing. |\n| 5. | Substrate Module: Iris-Ejection | pallet: https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris/tree/milestone_1/pallets/iris-ejection and chain extension: https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris/blob/9931ae51c4ecfdb972e65f4dce2698a3be028b75/runtime/src/lib.rs#L974| This introduces the module through which asset class ownership can associate rule executors with their assets and allows rule executors to submit execution results on chain. We also expose the functionality via an addition to our chain extension. |\n| 6. | Substrate Module: Iris-Session | https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris/tree/milestone_1/pallets/iris-session | The iris-session pallet was modified to read requests added to the DataRetrievalQueue as defined in the IrisEjection pallet. Further, we removed all references to the offchain::ipfs integration and have added http bindings (that are currently not in use until the next milestone) to communicate with go-ipfs. |\n| 7. | User Interface | https://github.com/ideal-lab5/ui | The user interface is very minimal and somewhat self explanatory. Error messages are minimal and though there is a specific flow which users must follow in order to interact with assets in iris (as elaborated in the testing guide), this user interface does not follow any specific worflow. Demo/walkthrough available on request. |\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nSee the testing guide.\n",

We also build a module to bridge between IPFS and Iris.\n* We modify the user interface to provide a simple way to start the ingestion process, view data about asset classes, and ultimately to decrypt and download data.\n\nSee the medium article, tech docs, and demo video for deeper context and more information.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| 0a. | License | https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris | Apache 2, GPL3| \n| 0b.  | Documentation | https://ideal-lab5.github.io | Also see codebase | \n| 0c.  | Testing Guide | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GYizRCtMYxfZEdpaB8_VBwSaZdG3kZQAhRJI3OGmZqA/edit?usp=sharing | Also see documentation for in depth guides on getting set up |\n| 0d.  | Docker |  Iris node: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ideallabs/iris, Iris UI:  https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ideallabs/iris-ui | |\n| 0e.  | Article | https://medium.com/ideal-labs/iris-update-milestone-2-29dcd8b79134 | |\n| 1.  | Substrate Module: IrisProxy | https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris/tree/main/pallets/iris-proxy | |\n| 2.  | Substrate Module: IPFS | https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris/tree/main/pallets/ipfs | |\n| 3.  | Substrate Module: Gateway | https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris/tree/main/pallets/gateway | |\n| 4.  | Encryption Mechanism | Key fragment generation starts here: https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris/blob/73735046ddf1776b912859daeab789a769130e72/pallets/iris-proxy/src/lib.rs#L584, see the whitepaper as well: https://github.com/ideal-lab5/whitepaper/blob/main/IRIS_PROTOCOL_DRAFT_0.0.1.pdf | |\n| 5.  | RPC: Encryption RPC | https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris/blob/ff95f2e811386f6231c441fafe3a1204ed82676b/pallets/iris-proxy/src/lib.rs#L518 | |\n| 6.  | RPC: Decryption RPC | https://github.com/ideal-lab5/iris/blob/ff95f2e811386f6231c441fafe3a1204ed82676b/pallets/iris-proxy/src/lib.rs#L390 | |\n| 7. | Testnet Setup | Documentation of hosted node setup: https://ideal-lab5.github.io/developers/nodes/ec2_setup.html | Testnet credentials, access to EC2 instances, and any other information will be made available to testers as needed. |\n| 8. | User Interface | https://github.com/ideal-lab5/ui | |\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nIn general, as part of the test setup we rely on a small three-validator testnet that we setup on AWS using t2.micro instances. Full access to these instances can be provided to whoever is performing the testing on this milestone. We'll provide a .pem that you can use to ssh into each instance. To setup your own testnet, you can see the hosted node setup guide linked in deliverable number 7. There is a script that can be run in any linux distro that will install iris and dependencies, and from there it's only a matter of running three validators to get block finalization to start.",

We expanded the political system, adding a separation of power between\nCongress, Senate, LLM tokens and headcount citizens. There is now support for underage citizens, legislation vetoes, new vote delegation system,\nthe offices pallet, KYC for validators.\n\nFor grant related tasks, we added the office pallet, registries and metaverse integration.\n\nThe offices pallet are meant to mimic real world government offices on-chain. It allows clerks to execute permissioned calls on behalf of the office.\nFor example, an identity registrar is a wallet address of the Ministry of Interior office, and any Ministry of Interior clerk can\ndispatch provideJudgement calls as the Ministry of Interior. Clerks have sets of permissions - which calls they can or cannot dispatch.\nClerks can be hired or fired by the office Admin, and office admins are appointed through the political system.\nAll of our registries have a corresponding instance of the office pallet.\n\nLiberland registry pallets allow companies and assets to be registered on-chain. In combination with the upcoming judiciary system, this\nwill allow running of traditional businesses, smart and dumb contracts on chain. For example, an insurance company could operate entirely\non-chain, with disputes handled via a traditional-like court system that has the limited power to enforce wordy contracts, allowing for\nmuch greater confidence in and adoption of on-chain businesses.\n\nCompany registry pallet and companyRegistryOffice are custom pallets that handle the requirements of business registration, explained\nmore in depth in the [testing guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ntrT6bafTD2LfXUG9QLxOieogXELn9icN1y__EGfZ98/edit#heading=h.jdlftz66hx0s).\nA missing upcoming WIP feature is selective encryption of data - for example, not all company shareholders may want to be public, \nbut they still need to be known to the Registry and be able to prove their data in a ZK way.\n\nLand, Metaverse Land and Asset registries are office-managed collections of the nfts pallet. We have a LandRegistryOffice,\nMetaverseLandRegistryOffice and AssetRegistryOffice that all behave more or less in the same way.\nSee [testing guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ntrT6bafTD2LfXUG9QLxOieogXELn9icN1y__EGfZ98/edit#heading=h.jdlftz66hx0s) for details.\n\nSince nfts pallet provided most functionality that was required, we did not have to create a whole new metaverse integration pallet from\nscratch, Instead we modified it to provide metadata validation of geocoordinates and created integration middleware in the form of a public API that reads\nmetaverse plots of lands from the blockchain and is connected to the metaverse. The flow of data is Blockchain nfts -> middleware API -> metaverse. Some of the geo checks include making sure a land nft is within configurable coordinates, format of geocoordinates is correct, land plot is a closed loop, land plot doesnt self intersect etc...\n\n- [Register, Manage and run on-chain companies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ntrT6bafTD2LfXUG9QLxOieogXELn9icN1y__EGfZ98/edit#heading=h.la6hgf9tw9qp)\n- [Register virtual land, where the land in the metaverse is managed by a pallet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ntrT6bafTD2LfXUG9QLxOieogXELn9icN1y__EGfZ98/edit#heading=h.98cfecawie0o)\n- [Trade with on-chain assets, NFT's and LLM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ntrT6bafTD2LfXUG9QLxOieogXELn9icN1y__EGfZ98/edit#heading=h.r11hvyl51i4a)\n- [e-citizenship, you can apply for an e-citizenship](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ntrT6bafTD2LfXUG9QLxOieogXELn9icN1y__EGfZ98/edit#heading=h.pph4a9bhmlev)\n\n\n",

The controller implementing the REST resources for protection request handling is defined in [this file](https://github.com/logion-network/logion-backend-ts/blob/grant1-milestone1/src/logion/controllers/protectionrequest.controller.ts). Unit tests are located in [this file](https://github.com/logion-network/logion-backend-ts/blob/grant1-milestone1/test/unit/controllers/protectionrequest.controller.spec.ts). Note that most resources require the caller to be authenticated. The authentication \"protocol\" is described [here](https://github.com/logion-network/logion-backend-ts/blob/grant1-milestone1/doc/Authentication.md) and implemented using resources defined in [this file](https://github.com/logion-network/logion-backend-ts/blob/grant1-milestone1/src/logion/controllers/authentication.controller.ts).

The account protection and recovery processes are implemented (off-chain and on-chain) and ready to be used.\"\n\nWe have worked on the evolution and maturation of our project. As we are ready to move on to the next steps, the time is appropriate to propose the review of our first millestone.\n\nIf you have any questions about this millestone, our organization, our project as a whole, contact us.\nWe are developing specific services. Through these we want to contribute to the enhancement of the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nThe recovery service could, for example, be used by a wallet like Talisman or another. It could be the same with the multisign option using logion network legal officiers as institutional and neutral gardians.\n",

You can start a manta local testnet using this code.\n* [manta-front-end](https://github.com/Manta-Network/manta-front-end): A minimal web front-end for Manta that is forked from `substrate-front-end-template`.\n\n## Run a Manta Demo\n\nDetailed instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/Manta-Network/manta-node#demo).\n\n![step3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/720571/110532076-3b84a100-80d1-11eb-9c7b-ab7f98350a0b.png)\n\n## Run from docker\n\n1. download and run the manta node:\n   1. `docker pull mantalab/manta-node:w3f-milestone-1`\n   2. `docker container run -p 9944:9944 mantalab/manta-node:w3f-milestone-1`\n2. setup the front end \n    1. `git clone https://github.com/Manta-Network/manta-front-end`\n    2. `cd manta-front-end`\n    3. `yarn install`\n    4. `yarn start`\n\n## Test Coverage\n\nDetailed instructions to run test coverage can be found [here](https://github.com/Manta-Network/pallet-manta-dap#test-coverage).\n\n![Result](https://github.com/Manta-Network/pallet-manta-dap/blob/master/coverage/coverage.png)\n\n\n## Benchmark\n\nDetailed instructions to run Benchmark can be found [benchmark](https://github.com/Manta-Network/pallet-manta-dap#benchmark).\n\nSummary of Benchmark Result:\n| Function      | init |  trasfer | mint | manta_transfer | forfeit |\n| ----------- |:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|\n| Rust       |    640 us   |  13 us | 1.9 ms | 10.1 ms | 8.8 ms |\n| Wasm |    2.8 ms    |  111  us | 13.1 ms | 130 ms | 107 ms |\n",

It consists of the framework (Tesseract Core), that provides the APIs for both the dApp and Wallet sides - they are called \"client\" and \"service\" respectively in the repo. The framework also provides extension APIs for transports (IPC, TCP/IP, etc.) and protocols (Polkadot, Ethereum, etc.) development.\n\nThe repo has quite a comprehensive documentation. The good starting point is README.MD in the root folder, which is interlinked with the rest of the docs.\n\nFor the testing purposes we opted for a playground-style demo application which uses all the aspects of the framework, by providing simple test protocol and local transport implementation, demonstrating how the implementation works.\n\nTo run - simply navigate to `tesseract-playground` inside the repo and `cargo run`.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| 0a. | License | [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/tesseract-one/Tesseract.rs/blob/master/LICENSE)|  |\n| 0b. | Documentation | [README.MD](https://github.com/tesseract-one/Tesseract.rs/blob/master/README.md) | please, see \"usage\" section for links with more detailed docs |\n| 0c. | Testing Guide | [gdoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14kaTRfZoiHsQ7eLiC1q9jcWddrNeh9PxTa4dSA5OxNI/edit?usp=sharing) |  |\n| 0d. | Docker | N/A | not applicable for this deliverable |\n| 0e. | Article | [gdoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PULJiNfKABkM4xsvsKp6_EgbKvxuxCZxxPbka2T7zVc/edit?usp=sharing) | will be bublished on Medium after approval |\n| 1. | Architecture | N/A | architecture is described in the article and the docs, also can be explored in the code |\n| 2. | Application-level framework | [example protocol](https://github.com/tesseract-one/Tesseract.rs/tree/master/tesseract-playground/src/polkadot) | probably the best place to start is this example link. Protocols APIs are have common part for the call messages and separate for the friendly APIs for `client` and `service`. Please, also consider checking out the Protocols doc section (see link below) |\n| 3. | Messages and envelopes | [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-one/Tesseract.rs/tree/master/tesseract) | `tesseract` sub repo serves as a depencency for both `tesseract-client` and `tesseract-service` and contains most of the data layer |\n| 4. | Transport-level framework | [example \"local\" transport](https://github.com/tesseract-one/Tesseract.rs/tree/master/tesseract-playground/src/plt) | probably the best place to start is this example link. Transports APIs are separate for the `client` and `service`. Please, also consider checking out the Transports doc (see link below) |\n| 5. | Transport-layer development APIs | [Transports](https://github.com/tesseract-one/Tesseract.rs/blob/master/EXTENDING.MD#Transport) | a doc that explains how to create a transport. Please, also consider checking out `tesseract-playground` |\n| 6. | Application-layer development APIs | [Protocols](https://github.com/tesseract-one/Tesseract.rs/blob/master/EXTENDING.MD#Protocol) | a doc that explains how to create a blockchain protocol support. Please, also consider checking out `tesseract-playground` |\n\n\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nWe opted for README-style docs and playground demo style app for testing for the reasons that the APIs might be changing quite a lot during the next milestone where we implement actual Polkadot support and real life IPC transports for iOS and Android. We believe that we should rather battle test current Tesseract Core during the next milestone, improve it based on new input and then make comprehensive API docs and stuff, instead of wasting time now for things we know may change.\n\nThe overall structure and approach is going to stay as it is though.\n",

The `no_std` versions of the dependencies (`rust-bitcoin` and `rust-miniscript`) have been developed but are not yet released. Once those are released, BDK will updated and we will integrate those changes into our solution. You can follow progress with this [open issue](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/issues/205).\n\nAlso, instead of using Spectre Desktop or Caravan as the signer, we are using the mobile app [BlueWallet](https://github.com/BlueWallet). It is open source React Native and available on both app stores. This was a bit more difficult because it required the additional deliverable of encoding the payloads as QR codes. However, we believe it is an overall better fit, more secure, and improved UX over the other options.\n\nWe also originally intended to use the identity pallet `additional` mapping for storing the `xpub`. However, updating this field drops verification judgements from the identity, which of course would not be a desired effect. Instead, we save the `xpub` with our pallet. There is no impact to user experience.\n\n**Deliverables**\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| 0a. | License | https://github.com/hashed-io/hashed-substrate/blob/main/LICENSE  | MIT |\n| 0b. | Pallet Documentation | https://github.com/hashed-io/hashed-substrate/tree/main/pallets/nbv-storage | The code has inline documentation and each repository has a detailed README with build, run, and test instructions. |\n| 0c. | Testing Guide | https://github.com/hashed-io/bdk-services/blob/master/src/hbdk/mod.rs#L457, https://github.com/hashed-io/hashed-substrate/blob/main/pallets/nbv-storage/src/tests.rs  | Tests are build directly into Rust projects, integration tests shown in video described below |\n| 0d. | Docker | https://github.com/hashed-io/bdk-services/blob/master/Dockerfile | Dockerfile for `bdk_services` is used to deploy to Kubernetes |\n| 0e. | Video | https://youtu.be/OYKvt-xir3E  | 15-minute video details the milestone delivery and demonstrates the software  |\n| 1. | BDK Integration | https://github.com/hashed-io/bdk-services | Web services that are invoked via offchain-worker; will be replaced with `no_std` version of BDK in future release |  \n| 2. | Account `xpub` | https://github.com/hashed-io/hashed-substrate/blob/main/pallets/nbv-storage/src/lib.rs#L349 | User can set an `xpub` associated to their account within the NBV pallet |  \n| 3. | Output Descriptors | https://github.com/hashed-io/bdk-services/blob/master/README.md#generate-output-descriptors | Generate output descriptor (vault/wallet) based on the selected Vault Signers |  \n| 4. | Generate Receiving Addresses | https://github.com/hashed-io/bdk-services/blob/master/README.md#generate-new-address | NBV will be able to generate receiving addresses for a vault (can be generated on web or mobile) |  \n| 5. | List and View vaults | https://github.com/hashed-io/native-bitcoin-vaults-UI | NBV client will show a list of treasuries/vault, their labels, and the eligible signers |  \n| 6. | Pass to Signer | https://github.com/hashed-io/nbv-ur-codec | Web client communicates with BlueWallet mobile app via QR codes |  \n\n**Repositories** \n(all MIT licensed)\n| Component | Repo | Language |\n| -----: | ----------- | ------- |\n| Pallet | [Hashed Substrate](https://github.com/hashed-io/hashed-substrate/tree/main/pallets/nbv-storage) | Rust\n| Bitcoin Services | [BDK Services](https://github.com/hashed-io/bdk-services) | Rust |\n| Client | [Web App](https://github.com/hashed-io/native-bitcoin-vaults-UI) | Quasar/Vuejs |\n| QR Codec | [QR Encoding Package](https://github.com/hashed-io/nbv-ur-codec) | Javascript |\n\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nWe will create more extensive and polished end user documentation with the full product release (next milestone).",

Starting from scratch, we faced the challenge of developing every component of this project ourselves. This was no easy task, but it was a process we thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nOur goal was to create a contract that enables anyone to configure and generate their own payroll system, providing a solution for organizations that wish to make transparent payments. We aimed to create a more transparent and secure world, where payments are not only technologically advanced, but also practical and applicable to everyday life.\n\nThe development process was a learning curve, as we had to design a user-friendly interface, develop the payroll contract and integrate the UI with the contract. Each step was a challenge in its own right, but we were determined to overcome them.\n\nWe are proud to say that the Open Payroll project is a testament to our commitment to leveraging blockchain technology to build real-life solutions.\n\nWe are immensely grateful to the Web3 Foundation (w3f) for the opportunity to contribute to the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem. This project would not have been possible without their support. We look forward to continuing our work in this space and exploring new ways to leverage blockchain technology for the betterment of society.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| 0a. | License | <div><div>Frontend: https://github.com/polkadrys/open-payroll-web/blob/main/LICENSE</div><div>Smart Contract: https://github.com/polkadrys/openPayroll/blob/main/LICENSE</div></div>  | |\n| 0b.    | Documentation                                                | <div><div>Frontend: https://github.com/polkadrys/open-payroll-web/blob/main/README.md</div><div> Smart Contract: https://github.com/polkadrys/openPayroll/blob/main/README.md</div></div>  |  |\n| 0c.    | Testing and Testing Guide                                    | <div><div>Frontend: https://github.com/polkadrys/open-payroll-web/blob/main/e2e/README.md</div><div> Smart Contract: https://github.com/polkadrys/openPayroll/blob/main/README.md#run-the-tests</div></div>  |  |\n| 0d.    | Docker                                                       | <div><div>Frontend: https://github.com/polkadrys/open-payroll-web/blob/main/Dockerfile</div><div> Smart Contract: https://github.com/polkadrys/openPayroll/blob/main/Dockerfile</div></div> | Instructions to run the containers are detailed in the README.md files. |\n| 1.| Desing frontend interface (Figma) | https://www.figma.com/file/FkHVzkM1dcn8rHkKjegYW0/OpenPayroll?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=hQcmM0GOdGQsvPji-1 | The figma has multiple sections such as Empathy, Design, UI, Wireframes, Wireframes Mobile and Landing |\n| 2. | Develop the interface based on the previous task result | https://github.com/polkadrys/open-payroll-web/tree/main | |\n| 3. | Develop the payroll smart contract | https://github.com/polkadrys/openPayroll/tree/main | |\n| 4. | Integrate the UI with the contracts | https://github.com/polkadrys/open-payroll-web/tree/main | |\n| 5. | Quality Assurance | https://github.com/polkadrys/open-payroll-web/tree/main/e2e | |\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nHere's the link to the live deployment of the frontend:\nhttps://open-payroll.vercel.app\n\n",

You can deploy this contract on your local substrate-contracts-node and test its functionality, or just automatically test it with `npm run test` (the tests `MY_PSP22_PALLET`, `MY_PSP22_PALLET_BURNABLE`, `MY_PSP22_METADATA` and `MY_PSP22_PALLET_MINTABLE` are testing the pallet asset chain extension functionality)\n  - ink! team created a [chain-extension registry](https://github.com/paritytech/chainextension-registry) which standardizes the chain extensions. Our team registered the pallet-assets chain extension in [this commit](https://github.com/paritytech/chainextension-registry/commit/5d4d180e62d0cc8df01093c2440fb13521722688) (completing Deliverable 4)\n- Deliverable 5:\n  - Our team created a [PR to ink! repository](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/1589) with this functionality. We also added [test](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/blob/d5524bda1d8ffb558c5f83f1a8f82749730b8e52/examples/delegator/adder/lib.rs) which tests the cross-contract calls, you can test it by running the ink! unit test with `cargo test` on [these contracts](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/tree/d5524bda1d8ffb558c5f83f1a8f82749730b8e52/examples/reentrancy). This functionality works on-chain, the point of the deliverable was adding this utility to off-chain testing environment, so this is the only way you can test this deliverable.\n- Delivearble 6:\n  - The `pallet-assets` already supports XCM, that's why we created an article on how this works, and a guide how to do it on medium.\n- Deliverable 7:\n  - OpenBrush now uses ink! 4.0.0-beta, therefore testing the OpenBrush repository either with `npm run test` (integration tests) or `RUSTFLAGS=\"-D warnings\" cargo +nightly test --workspace --features test-all -- --test-threads=10` (unit tests) will show the results of this deliverable (everything works). You can even deploy some of the OpenBrush smart contracts on your local testing node and test its functionality to see that it works.\n- Deliverable 8a.:\n  - We created the two tutorials mentioned. This is just the beginning of our tutorial series and there will be more in the future.\n- Deliverable 8b.:\n  - We added some SEO to our website, however it may take some time to show results.\n- Notes to testing:\n  - Please, make sure that before any tests you meet the following requirements:\n    - You have installed the `cargo-contract` version `2.0.0-beta.1` (`cargo install cargo-contract --version 2.0.0-beta.1`)\n    - You have added the nightly toolchain of rust (`rustup toolchain add nightly`)\n  - When running the integration tests, please make sure you are running a local testing node\n    - We recommend (the default) latest version (0.23) of `substrate-contracts-node`. You can find the node [here](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node/releases/tag/v0.23.0).\n",

The old examples have been updated according to new features(integration test for them without changes). | \n| 1.  | Remove boilerplate code |[`#[brush::contract]`](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/blob/783406805c4ef86176d4a3500db6840c5b7f059a/utils/brush/proc_macros/lib.rs#L15), [`#[brush::trait_definition]`](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/blob/783406805c4ef86176d4a3500db6840c5b7f059a/utils/brush/proc_macros/lib.rs#L173)| Combination of `#[brush::contract]` and `#[brush::trait_definition]` macros allow to avoid boilerplate code. Example of `PSP22` contract [with this feature](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/blob/783406805c4ef86176d4a3500db6840c5b7f059a/examples/psp22/lib.rs#L20) and [without](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/blob/20cd7a98f70f7a91d546baaa7cf032b6ba776e93/examples/erc20/lib.rs#L100). | \n| 2.  | Derive for storages |[Derive macro rule](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/blob/783406805c4ef86176d4a3500db6840c5b7f059a/utils/brush_derive_macro/lib.rs#L11), [Helper macro rules](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/blob/783406805c4ef86176d4a3500db6840c5b7f059a/utils/brush/macros.rs)| The library is using a clear and simple data model. If the user wants to reuse some trait from the library. He must derive corresponding storage(for [example](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/blob/783406805c4ef86176d4a3500db6840c5b7f059a/examples/psp22/lib.rs#L10)). If the user wants to define his trait, he has to define some data struct(for [example](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/blob/783406805c4ef86176d4a3500db6840c5b7f059a/contracts/token/psp22/traits.rs#L33)) and use `declare_storage_trait!` to declare a trait. The user also can easily create derive macro for his trait, by reusing `declare_derive_storage_trait!` macro rule(for [example](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/tree/783406805c4ef86176d4a3500db6840c5b7f059a/contracts/token/psp22/derive)). | \n| 3.  | Support default implementation in external traits |[`#[brush::trait_definition]`](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/blob/783406805c4ef86176d4a3500db6840c5b7f059a/utils/brush/proc_macros/lib.rs#L173)| The macro allows having methods in the trait with default implementation of method, default types, constants, and any other stuff from the rust(except generics in ink! messages). [Example how it looks like](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/blob/783406805c4ef86176d4a3500db6840c5b7f059a/contracts/token/psp22/traits.rs#L70). | \n| 4.  | Support of modifiers |[`#[brush::modifier_definition]`](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/blob/783406805c4ef86176d4a3500db6840c5b7f059a/utils/brush/proc_macros/lib.rs#L204), [`#[brush::modifiers]`](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/blob/783406805c4ef86176d4a3500db6840c5b7f059a/utils/brush/proc_macros/lib.rs#L336)| `#[brush::modifier_definition]` validates that modifier has been declared right according to expected rules. `#[brush::modifiers]` applies modifiers to a function. | \n| 5.  | ReentrancyGuard |[Implementation](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/tree/783406805c4ef86176d4a3500db6840c5b7f059a/contracts/security/reentrancy-guard), [Example](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/tree/783406805c4ef86176d4a3500db6840c5b7f059a/examples/reentrancy-guard), [Integration test](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/blob/783406805c4ef86176d4a3500db6840c5b7f059a/tests/reentrancy_guard.tests.ts)| Implemented [ReentrancyGuard](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol) from OpenZeppelin.

We found several moments that can be optimized:\n\n- [Replacing `#[inline(always)]` by `#[inline]`](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/1012)\n  helped to reduce the size of contracts with a lot of messages. \n  It helped because the compiler decided by self where better to inline to reduce the size of the contract.\n  [The report about size reduction](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/1012#pullrequestreview-804747290).\n- [That change](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/1017) contains many small optimizations \n  that allow reducing the size of the code well. We can't extract them to \n  separate PRs because they depend on each other. The main idea is to move common\n  parts of each message to one place instead of duplicating them. Reworking of \n  `scale::Decode::decode` logic for arguments also improves the size. \n  Initially, this change was implemented by [the PR](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/999). \n  But later we found how it can be optimized more and created a [new PR](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/1017). \n  Description of the PR contains a report about the size and [this comment](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/1017#issuecomment-970575796).\n\nDuring the implementation of the [PR](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/1017) \nwe found out that sub-contracts from the `delegator` example take a lot of space \nin comparison to other simple contracts. We investigated that point and found  out \nthe reason in `workspace`. We created [that report](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/1054) \nand later created the fix in [`cargo-contract`](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract/pull/378).\n\nDuring debugging of `#[inline]` methods we figured out that applying of `-Clinker-plugin-lto` \nflag during compilation reduces the size of the contract. For small contracts, \nit is ~200 bytes, for big ~900 bytes. We heve done [PR](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract/pull/358) \nin the `cargo-contract` repository with that fix.\n\nDuring analyzing of the dispatching WASM blob, we explored that `scale:::Decode` \nis not optimally implemented for `AccountId`(and for all arrays like `[u8; N]` structures). \nWe heve done a [change](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/1016) in ink! repository([report](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/1016#issuecomment-970425793)). \nBut later we implemented that change in [`parity-scale-codec`](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec/pull/299). \nIt also [improved the performance](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec/pull/299#issuecomment-974819024) \nduring runtime for all WASM-based code(so it also improved some stuff in `substrate`).\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| 0b. | Documentation | In context section | Each pull request and the issue contains information about size-reduction. | \n| 1.  | Reduce the size of Erc20 contract | In context section | We did several changes to reduce the size of the contract. A detailed report in the context section. | \n\n**Additional Information**\n\nWe did more progress than specified in the grant application.\n\nWhat was specified:\n> We want to briefly(not full change, only minimal changes to reduce the size) implement them and provide a report(re-working data structure, reducing monomorphization, using dynamic dispatch in some cases).\n\nIn the description of the milestone, we mentioned that we're going to do \"not full change, \nonly minimal changes to reduce the size\", but we implemented them fully and it took more time.\nIs it possible to increase payment for that milestone from 9,000 USD to 15,000?\n",

Contract builder process image\n      is used to provide an environment for the contract build itself, and is a necessary component that has to be used with a container engine such as Docker.\n      The API server is provided as a Docker image too, but can also be built and deployed without Docker.\n        - API server Docker image can be downloaded from [main project repository](https://github.com/Brushfam/patron-backend) releases\n          or built with Nix tooling:\n            ```sh\n            nix build .#docker.server\n            ```\n            - Contract builder process Docker image can be built with Nix tooling\n              (it's necessary to provide a way to modify self-hosted domain):\n            ```sh\n            nix build .#docker.ink-builder\n            ```\n- Deliverable 0e.:\n    - [Article](https://medium.com/brushfam/patron-is-your-one-stop-smart-contract-manager-for-polkadot-ecosystem-b1f89a48ba40)\n- Deliverable 1a.:\n    - To test this deliverable, you need to prepare a working instance of a PostgreSQL database and configure your local project\n      with instructions available in the [self-hosting documentation](https://github.com/Brushfam/patron-backend/blob/master/docs/self-hosted.md).\n    - Build the project with `cargo` or `nix`:\n        ```sh\n        cargo build --release\n        ```\n      or\n        ```sh\n        nix build .#\n        ```\n    - Run database migrations:\n        ```sh\n        ./target/release/migration\n        ```\n- Deliverable 1b.:\n    - Ensure that you have the database prepared with instructions from the deliverable 1a.\n    - Initialize the database with the following command:\n        ```sh\n        ./target/release/event_client initialize [name] [url] [schema]\n        ```\n      For example, to initialize an Astar node:\n        ```sh\n        ./target/release/event_client initialize astar wss://1rpc.io:443/astr astar\n        ```\n    - Start watching for new events from this node using the following command:\n        ```sh\n        ./target/release/event_client watch astar\n        ```\n    - See [self-hosting documentation](https://github.com/Brushfam/patron-backend/blob/master/docs/self-hosted.md) for more\n      details on how to use the event client (also known as sync server).\n- Deliverable 1c.:\n    - Ensure that you have the database prepared with instructions from the deliverable 1a.\n    - For testing this deliverable, you can either use hosted or self-hosted versions of smart contract builder.\n    - For testing the hosted version, refer to deliverable 3a testing instructions.\n    - For testing self-hosted version, you'll need a Linux server with Docker, `udisks2`, `fallocate` and `mkfs.ext4` available.\n        - More information on why these components are required is available [here](https://github.com/Brushfam/patron-backend/blob/master/docs/self-hosted.md#smart-contract-builder)\n    - Build the smart contract builder Docker image with Nix, while changing the preferred domain to a custom one in a\n      [flake.nix file](https://github.com/Brushfam/patron-backend/blob/202c60325a51af0b7762e1b72e4d609adbbdd56e/flake.nix#L61):\n      ```sh\n      nix build .#docker.ink-builder\n      ```\n    - Load the resulting image with `docker` CLI:\n      ```sh\n      docker load < result\n      ```\n    - Configure the smart contract builder according to the [self-hosting documentation](https://github.com/Brushfam/patron-backend/blob/master/docs/self-hosted.md).\n    - Start the smart contract builder with the following command:\n      ```sh\n      ./target/release/builder serve\n      ```\n- Deliverable 2a.:\n    - You can use [our website](https://patron.works) to test the hosted version of the web UI. You can use data from Astar\n      network to test the hosted version.\n    - [Self-hosted version](https://github.com/Brushfam/patron-frontend) can be built with the following command:\n      ```sh\n      npm i\n      REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=https://api.example.com npm run build\n      ```\n      Replace `https://api.example.com` with the URL of your API server.\n\n      To test non-production builds with built-in HTTP server you can use the following command:\n      ```sh\n      npm i\n      REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=https://api.example.com npm start\n      ```\n- Deliverable 2b.:\n    - You can search contract addresses and verified code hashes using the main page search bar.\n    - Contract address info will provide you with information on the contract's code hash, events,\n      source code and build log (if available).\n    - Verified code hashes will provide you with the source code and build log.\n- Deliverable 2c.:\n    - There are two separate authentication flows available - website and CLI flow.\n    - For CLI flow refer to deliverable 3a.\n    - For website flow, open either [hosted](https://patron.works) or self-hosted versions of a website.\n    - Click on the \"Log in\" button in the top-right corner of a screen.\n    - Choose a wallet that you would like to use for authentication purposes.\n    - Sign a message with the provided wallet (there are no fees associated with any wallet interactions).\n- Deliverable 3a.:\n    - Ensure that you have a Rust toolchain available\n      (`cargo-contract` installation is optional, as the CLI will attempt to download it automatically)\n    - Your project needs to have a `Deploy.toml` file, which describes the tooling versions with which\n      it has to be built. Consult the [CLI documentation](https://github.com/Brushfam/patron-backend/blob/master/docs/cli.md#deploy)\n      for more information on that.\n    - CLI provides developers with two commands - `auth` and `deploy`.\n        - `auth`\n            - `auth` command allows users to authenticate themselves to the API server.\n            - To use `auth` in a self-hosted environment you need to pass additional `-s` and `-w` flags:\n            ```sh\n            patron auth -s https://api.example.com -w https://example.com\n            ```\n          Where `https://api.example.com` is the URL of your API server, and `https://example.com`\n          is the URL of your web UI.\n            - Omit `-s` and `-w` flags to use the hosted version of an API server and web UI.\n            - After running the `auth` command, the CLI will automatically try to open the browser\n              for authentication purposes. If your platform does not support that functionality,\n              you can always open the URL manually, as it's in the same terminal.\n            - Use the same authentication instructions as were provided in the deliverable 2c.\n        - `deploy`\n            - `deploy` command is your entrypoint for smart contract deployment purposes.\n            - The interface is similar to that of a `cargo-contract`, and many flags that\n              are available to upload and instantiate a contract are available here.\n            - For testing, we can deploy to local `substrate-contracts-node` instance, which can be built using these commands:\n              ```sh\n              git clone https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node\n              cd substrate-contracts-node\n              cargo run\n              ```\n            - To deploy your smart contract, write the following command, replacing placeholders with the correct values for your contract:\n              ```sh\n              patron deploy [constructor] --suri [suri]\n              ```\n              `[constructor]` placeholder is the constructor method name, that will be called during instantiation phase.\n              `[suri]` is your secret URI string, which is passed verbatim to `cargo-contract`. For testing purposes we can use `//Alice`.\n            - The build process will start as soon as there are available smart contract builder instances. In this case,\n              you should see build logs appearing on your screen, allowing you to trace the build itself.",

The source code is documented.\n| 0c. | Testing Guide | [appchannel_test.go], [README] | The new functionality is tested in [appchannel_test.go]. The [README] describes how to run the tests. We also upgraded the [test node] to use the new Pallet version.\n| 0d. | Docker | [docker-compose.yml] | The [docker-compose.yml] starts up the node and runs the test.\n| 1. | Update backend | [go.mod] | We updated the Polkadot backend to go-perun v0.9.2. This included adapting the code to the relevant API changes and was done in [PR#11].\n| 2. | App identifier and data | [channel.go], [encoding.go]  | We extended the `Params` data structure by an `AppID` field and the `State` by a `Data` field. We adapted the encoding functionality accordingly. This was done as part of [PR#12].\n| 3. | Progress function | [adjudicator.go], [adjudicator_sub.go], [event.go], [channel.go], [appchannel_test.go] | We adapted the Polkadot binding to the changes in the Pallet. In particular, this included adapting  `RegisteredState` in [channel.go], the event types in [event.go], and the conclude logic in [adjudicator.go]. Then we integrated the on-chain progression call for app channel functionality ([adjudicator.go]). We also adapted the event subscription by a new event type ([adjudicator_sub.go]). We added the end-to-end test for app channel functionality ([appchannel_test.go]). All of this was done as part of [PR#12].\n\n[LICENSE]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-backend/blob/46d11537a97a268fe0fe62d95c53182086fe3e66/LICENSE\n[README]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-backend/blob/46d11537a97a268fe0fe62d95c53182086fe3e66/README.md\n[appchannel_test.go]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-backend/blob/46d11537a97a268fe0fe62d95c53182086fe3e66/client/appchannel_test.go\n[test node]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-node\n[docker-compose.yml]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-backend/blob/46d11537a97a268fe0fe62d95c53182086fe3e66/docker-compose.yml\n[go.mod]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-backend/blob/46d11537a97a268fe0fe62d95c53182086fe3e66/go.mod\n[PR#11]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-backend/pull/11\n[channel.go]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-backend/blob/46d11537a97a268fe0fe62d95c53182086fe3e66/channel/channel.go\n[encoding.go]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-backend/blob/46d11537a97a268fe0fe62d95c53182086fe3e66/channel/encoding.go\n[PR#12]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-backend/pull/12\n[adjudicator.go]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-backend/blob/46d11537a97a268fe0fe62d95c53182086fe3e66/channel/pallet/adjudicator.go\n[event.go]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-backend/blob/46d11537a97a268fe0fe62d95c53182086fe3e66/channel/event.go\n[adjudicator_sub.go]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-backend/blob/46d11537a97a268fe0fe62d95c53182086fe3e66/channel/pallet/adjudicator_sub.go\n[appchannel_test.go]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-backend/blob/46d11537a97a268fe0fe62d95c53182086fe3e66/client/appchannel_test.go\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nWe look forward to working on the next and final milestone of this project :)\n",

The third milestone focuses on demonstrating the new functionality in form of a CLI game client.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| 0a. | License | [LICENSE] | Apache License, Version 2.0\n| 0b. | Documentation | [README] | The [README] introduces the repository and its functionality. The source code is documented.\n| 0c. | Testing Guide | [README] | The [README] describes how to test the game client.\n| 0d. | Docker | [Node:Dockerfile] | We have updated the [polkadot-test-node image] to include the Tic-Tac-Toe app.\n| 0e. | Article | [Google Doc] (Draft) | The article is currently in review by the W3F Grants team and shall be published on Medium.com afterwards.\n| 1. | Pallet game logic | [Node:app.rs] | We have implemented the Tic-tac-toe on-chain game logic in form of a valid transition function ([Node:PR#20]). We have also enhanced the Perun Pallet by a few standard checks and a more permissive timeout logic ([Pallet:PR#21], [Pallet:PR#22]).\n| 2. | Off-chain game logic | [app/] | We have implemented the off-chain game logic in package [app/].\n| 3. | Game client | [client/] | We have implemented a demo game client in package [client/]. The main routine is in [main.go] and the command line commands are in [command.go]. The [README] gives an overview of how to use the client.\n\n[LICENSE]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-appdemo/blob/0387dd6dd73c3b2ec11c8d8028c8fb6fbb908f9b/LICENSE\n[README]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-appdemo/blob/0387dd6dd73c3b2ec11c8d8028c8fb6fbb908f9b/README.md\n[Node:Dockerfile]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-node/blob/a5d1981f7d7ad6132a37405ec01f22ae4bba2ed1/node/Dockerfile\n[polkadot-test-node image]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-node/pkgs/container/polkadot-test-node\n[Google Doc]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aO05SZgDmabtYBNySm91It7oxinTFg-HArs7N4_aA4Y/edit?usp=sharing\n[Node:app.rs]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-node/blob/a5d1981f7d7ad6132a37405ec01f22ae4bba2ed1/node/runtime/src/app.rs\n[Node:PR#20]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-node/pull/20\n[Pallet:PR#21]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-pallet/pull/21\n[Pallet:PR#22]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-pallet/pull/22\n[app/]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-appdemo/tree/0387dd6dd73c3b2ec11c8d8028c8fb6fbb908f9b/app\n[client/]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-appdemo/tree/0387dd6dd73c3b2ec11c8d8028c8fb6fbb908f9b/client\n[main.go]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-appdemo/blob/0387dd6dd73c3b2ec11c8d8028c8fb6fbb908f9b/main.go\n[command.go]: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-appdemo/blob/0387dd6dd73c3b2ec11c8d8028c8fb6fbb908f9b/command.go\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nTogether with Ajuna we have investigated how Perun Channels could be further integrated with their game developer platform. We have found that Ajuna's [TurnBasedGame interface] is relatively similar to Perun's [App interface].\n\nOne idea was that we could write an adapter that allows plug-and-play use of Ajuna Games in Perun Channels. However, here a challenge is that Perun Apps are split between an off-chain part and an on-chain part, where the off-chain part is written in Go, while Ajuna's Games are written in Rust. To provide a plug-and-play solution, we would need to write a component that integrates Rust code in Go. This may be done as part of a future project.\n\nWe thank the Web3 Foundation for sponsoring this project.\n\n[TurnBasedGame interface]: https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna/blob/5a2be3460d7f737724bf389b466a3819e68d684a/ajuna-common/src/lib.rs#L131\n[App interface]: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/go-perun/blob/2b78f88753afa2e6191c80c6bf5481a64a0432c6/channel/app.go#L51\n",

The backend is a Rust application that compiles the contracts and stores them in a database. The database is a MongoDB instance that stores the compiled contracts and the deployed contracts information.\n\n**Milestone 1**\n\nBased on the initial interface design, we identified several opportunities for improvement. We incorporated elements such as a modern color scheme, improved typography, and a more intuitive layout to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. After completing the design phase, we moved on to the development phase, where we created the frontend interface based on the design specifications. We optimized the code to ensure the interface was responsive, accessible, and compatible with different devices and web browsers.\n\nTo achieve the goal of enabling new users to create their own contracts in a few steps, the wizard provides them a set of options to customize and create tokens based on PSP. We implemented the logic to compose the contracts based on the selection made. Once the user has completed the wizard, they can preview the contract and copy the generated code. To improve the readability and ease of understanding of the smart contract code, we added syntax highlighting to the displayed code.\nWe implemented the wallet connection using the Polkadot-JS API library. The user can connect their wallet to the wizard and select the account they want to use.\n\n**Milestone 2 (Work in Progress)**\n\nOnce the generated contract is sent to the backend it will be compiled. In the meantime, the user has to fill in the required fields of the contract constructor and will be able to deploy it to any chain that supports the contracts pallet.\nWe dockerized the application to simplify the deployment process and ensure consistency across different environments. We created a Dockerfile that specified the dependencies and configuration of the application, built a Docker image from the Dockerfile, and deployed the image to a Docker container.\n\nA quick note: we understand that the current version of the wizard may not be fully functional. However, we want to assure that we have been working in parallel on the next milestone (Milestone 2) to address this issue. The Milestone 2 will introduce an on-demand contract compilation service and a database that will store compiled contracts to enhance user experience by reducing compilation time. Additionally, we will store deployed contracts information in the database to allow users to keep track of their deployments. We are confident that these new features will not only improve functionality but also provide a more streamlined and user-friendly experience.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n[Milestone 1 deployment preview](https://polkadot-contract-wizard-fbukarssr-proto-polkadot.vercel.app/)\n\n| Number | Deliverable                                                   | Link | Notes |\n| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ----- |\n| 0a.    | License.                                                      | https://github.com/protofire/polkadot-contract-wizard/blob/milestone-1/LICENSE  | ...   |\n| 0b.    | Documentation.                                                | https://github.com/protofire/polkadot-contract-wizard/blob/milestone-1/README.md  | ...   |\n| 0c.    | Testing and Testing Guide.                                    | https://github.com/protofire/polkadot-contract-wizard/blob/milestone-1/tests/Readme.md  | ...   |\n| 0d.    | Docker.                                                       | https://github.com/protofire/polkadot-contract-wizard#a-with-docker  | ...   |\n| 1.     | Redesign frontend interface.                                  | https://github.com/protofire/polkadot-contract-wizard/tree/milestone-1  | ...   |\n| 2.     | Develop the interface based on the previous task result.      | https://github.com/protofire/polkadot-contract-wizard/tree/milestone-1  | ...   |\n| 3.     | Compose the contract based on the selection.                  | https://github.com/protofire/polkadot-contract-wizard/tree/milestone-1  | ...   |\n| 4.     | Add syntax highlighting to the displayed smart contract code. | https://github.com/protofire/polkadot-contract-wizard/tree/milestone-1  | ...   |\n\n",

This milestone marks the completion of the wizard's functionality by adding the crucial capability of compiling and deploying contracts to the blockchain (currently Rococo Contracts only). To achieve this, we developed a backend service that handles both contract compilation and deployment tracking. The backend service was built using the robust and scalable Rocket framework, while cargo-contract was utilized for contract compilation. To store the necessary information, including contracts and their deployments, we deployed a MongoDB instance. This approach ensures that the contracts generated by this tool are compiled and deployed to the blockchain, and that users can access and track the status of their deployed contracts through a robust and reliable database system.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nThe completion of this grant marks only the beginning of the Polkadot Contract Wizard's development journey. We are committed to continuously enhancing the functionality and user experience. Our upcoming plans include implementing new features such as the ability to interact with deployed contracts through the wizard's UI, allowing users to edit contracts in the same interface, and adding more contract templates. These features will make it even more versatile and powerful, enabling developers and non developers to quickly and easily create smart contracts for their projects. We are confident that the Contract Wizard has the potential to become an indispensable tool for the community within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. We are excited to continue working on this development and to see how it evolves in the future.\n\n**Live Deployment**\n\nYou can access the live deployment of the Polkadot Contract Wizard [here](https://www.contractwizard.xyz/).\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n| Number | Deliverable                                                   | Link | Notes |\n| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ----- |\n| 0a    | License.                                                      | <div><div>Frontend: https://github.com/protofire/polkadot-contract-wizard/blob/milestone-2/LICENSE</div><div>Backend: https://github.com/protofire/ink-compiler-be/blob/main/LICENSE</div></div> |  |\n| 0b.    | Documentation.                                                | <div><div>Frontend: https://github.com/protofire/polkadot-contract-wizard/blob/milestone-2/README.md</div><div> Backend: https://github.com/protofire/ink-compiler-be/blob/main/README.md</div></div>  |  |\n| 0c.    | Testing and Testing Guide.                                    | <div><div>Frontend: https://github.com/protofire/polkadot-contract-wizard/blob/milestone-2/tests/Readme.md</div><div> Backend: https://github.com/protofire/ink-compiler-be/blob/main/README.md#testing</div></div>  |  |\n| 0d.    | Docker.                                                       | https://github.com/protofire/polkadot-contract-wizard/blob/milestone-2/docker-compose.yml |  |\n| 0e. | Article | https://medium.com/protofire-blog/introducing-the-polkadot-contract-wizard-a-game-changer-for-the-polkadot-and-kusama-ecosystem-fb9076880ca7 |  |\n| 1. | Create a service that allows on demand contract compilation and deployment. | https://github.com/protofire/ink-compiler-be/tree/main |  |\n| 2. | Develop Instance functionality. | https://github.com/protofire/polkadot-contract-wizard/tree/milestone-2 |  |\n",

The platform will allow users to retrieve and analyze data from various Polkadot-related sources (e.g., different parachains and components such as browser wallets), aligned with the POnto ontology [1, 2, 3]. Users will be able to specify their queries using a controlled natural language (CNL), and the platform will provide a query engine to process these queries. Additionally, the platform will provide a UI to support constructing queries and visualizing informative artifacts that represent query results. As well as support for composing customizable dashboards using these artifacts.\n\n**Deliverables**\n> In this milestone, we focused on constructing the foundation of the analytics platform by creating a knowledge base. We defined and implemented the base components for the dev environment that will be the basis for the proposed platform. This included evolving with POnto to address queries from the [Data Analysis Tools for Substrate-based Blockchains](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/RFPs/Under%20Development/data_analysis_tools.md) RFP and the Substrate-ETL project. An initial KB component (including triplestore database and basic API endpoint) was developed to handle operations over POnto entities.\n\nProject Repository: https://github.com/mobr-ai/PolkadotAnalytics\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| **0a.** | Copyright and Licenses | [Apache License](https://github.com/mobr-ai/PolkadotAnalytics/blob/main/LICENSE) | Apache 2.0 |\n| **0b.** | Documentation/Tutorial | [POnto documentation](https://www.mobr.ai/ponto) <br><br> [PAP endpoints](https://github.com/mobr-ai/PolkadotAnalytics/blob/main/pap/swagger.yml) <br><br> [source code documentation](https://github.com/mobr-ai/PolkadotAnalytics/tree/main/docs/pap) | Online documentation of the new version of the POnto Ontology <br><br> PAP swagger Documentation <br><br>PAP source code documentation.  <br><br> Refer to the README file on our repository to details about how to access the platform swagger endpoint. |\n| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide | [Tests](https://github.com/mobr-ai/PolkadotAnalytics/tree/main/pap/tests) <br><br> [How to test](https://github.com/mobr-ai/PolkadotAnalytics/blob/main/README.md) <br><br> [KB query guide](https://github.com/mobr-ai/PolkadotAnalytics/blob/main/docs/kb_guide.ipynb)| PAP tests <br><br> How to run the tests <br><br> Querying the KB API: a guide on how to query and test the KB. <br><br> The README file includes details on how to run the platform as well as how to execute all of its tests |\n| **0d.** | Docker | [Dockerfile](https://github.com/mobr-ai/PolkadotAnalytics/blob/main/Dockerfile) <br><br> [docker-compose](https://github.com/mobr-ai/PolkadotAnalytics/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) | Docker image for the KB Bootstrap. |\n| **0e.** | Article | [Medium post draft](https://medium.com/@mobrsys/building-the-foundation-the-first-stage-of-the-polkadot-analytics-platform-6e9fa6fdbf33) | Medium post about the proposed platform roadmap and what we achieved so far. |\n| **1.** | POnto Evolution | [POnto](https://github.com/mobr-ai/POnto) <br><br>[Technical Report](https://github.com/mobr-ai/POnto/blob/main/docs/pdf/POnto_v0.0.2_evolution_report.pdf) | New version of POnto ontology, addressing aspects from RFP and Substrate-ETL. <br><br> Technical Report describing the POnto evolution |\n| **2.** | KB Bootstrap | [PAP](https://github.com/mobr-ai/PolkadotAnalytics) | Python code with KB endpoints that interact with Jena triplestore database through fuseki-server.

We are reporting that progress just because it's nice to have. We are going to report full #2 milestone, later. \n\nList of #2 milestone **in progress** tasks:\n\n* Currently in our examples we allow only to pass U64 arguments, but we support for other kinds of arguments already, just we are looking how to make it possible to send transactions containing unknown types from the UI (otherwise it's ultra hard to demo it).\n* We have ready events processing (VM -> Pallet). \n* We have an alpha version of storage implemented using LCS (migrating to Polkadot codec seems too expensive for us).\n* We already have a publish module transaction ready, same with execute transaction.\n  \n",

See [documentation](https://github.com/pontem-network/move-tools/blob/master/resource-viewer/README.md) for details and examples. | \n\nSome items of current milestone we finished during previous [milestone #1](/deliveries/pontem-network_milestone-1.md), like items related to storage, events processing, yet we improved some functionality during this milestone, like adopted events similar to Diem format. Same with items related to publishing modules and executing scripts.\n\nWe are going forward, not everything we worked included in this milestone, as it also bug fixes, improvements, refactorings, you can find more in our repositories:\n\n* [Move VM](https://github.com/pontem-network/sp-move-vm)\n* [Move Pallet](https://github.com/pontem-network/sp-move)\n* [Move Tools](https://github.com/pontem-network/move-tools)\n\nIn the next milestone we also plan to improve documentation, up gitbook, add more examples and etc.\n",

Each transaction method in the pallet has weight that we get by calculating gas. The VM accepts gas during execution of module/script, and after execution we receive used gas and converts it to weight. [Read more](https://docs.pontem.network/03.-move-vm/gas). |\n| 1. | Non-VM balances compatibility | [Commit #1](https://github.com/pontem-network/sp-move/commit/195406e3e2d296594a3d021d3c99bffcc1a51117) | We've implemented Non-VM balances compatibility by transferring native balances in \"VM space\" as we call it by using native functions and `0x1::PONT::T` type.

See [RPC](https://docs.pontem.network/03.-move-vm/rpc) docs and [CLI](https://docs.pontem.network/02.-getting-started/cli). |\n| 4. | Documentation | [Commits](https://github.com/pontem-network/docs/commits/master) | We implemented large documentation and described as much as possible, we also continued to increase the amount of materials with more examples, tutorials, etc. See [docs](https://docs.pontem.network). |\n| 5. | Deployment of prod env | [Commit #1](https://github.com/pontem-network/sp-move/commit/755cc9bc2268f13f1b3e30a495cb1bd9feca0459) [Commit #2](https://github.com/pontem-network/sp-move/commit/d071378f719d427f687c2f3fa44a7ee123a8af93) [Testnet](https://docs.pontem.network/02.-getting-started/getting_started#connection-to-network) | We deployed our own private network as testnet, little modified docker files. Currently you can connect to testnet via UI or CLI using the address `wss://testnet.pontem.network/wss`. |\n| 6. | Disassembler adoption | [Commit #1](https://github.com/pontem-network/move-tools/commit/e269763405e2f0b4e629ed03da706dd8c7d3b7b9#diff-ad94159425a4e644ecb2cd3b265d3c1c176245797327099cacc1ff52047dd204) [Commit #2](https://github.com/pontem-network/move-tools/commit/1eb933958926401c452d9c5831099671e2ca1c3f#diff-ad94159425a4e644ecb2cd3b265d3c1c176245797327099cacc1ff52047dd204) | As we adopted Move Tools for Polkadot in previous milestones, here we just updated the disassembler with the right dialect and made small documentation. |\n| 7. | Unit-tests | [Tests #1](https://github.com/pontem-network/sp-move/commit/cce333b8808cd9bcf46c047d86ffbd841ef1eeea) [Tests #2](https://github.com/pontem-network/sp-move/commit/e981ab99544e1dee3e845e251f11f999cd540bb9) [Tests #3](https://github.com/pontem-network/sp-move/commit/49d6f1d8598aca86bf7e59f309a078cd573fcc0e) [Tests #4](https://github.com/pontem-network/sp-move/commit/b87042df7f439080bc941cf3bdfcbffbbec645ca) | We increase test coverage time to time because of active development and trying to cover new features, we also in-progress with benchmark tests. |\n \nDuring this milestone we also moved everything to Substrate version 3, written large documentation, up testnet, so anyone can connect and try without local build, implemented CLI, started migration on a new version of Diem VM that is currently in progress.\n \nPrevious time you suggested:\n \n> Could you allow specifying output filename for dove ct, for creating multiple Txs each with a different input. The workaround is to create multiple scripts, changing method names, but that's not very elegant. Just a suggestion 🙂\n \n[Done](https://github.com/pontem-network/move-tools/commit/69629b08b100f05a739e46cda2e447b64851b50f):\n\n```sh \ndove ct 'emit(100)' --output emit_100.mv\ndove ct 'emit(200)' -f emit.move --output emit_200.mv\n```\n\nThere are also updates to move-tools, like packages (because the deployment of stdlib is not painful anymore), support of `{{sender}}`, just FYI.\n \n* [Move VM](https://github.com/pontem-network/sp-move-vm)\n* [Move Pallet](https://github.com/pontem-network/sp-move)\n* [Move Tools](https://github.com/pontem-network/move-tools)\n \n",

Currently, it exists as a command line and API tool only with the frontend UI to be delivered as part of the next Milestone. The purpose of this Milestone has been to implement the backend design, as described in the Grant Application. The `Protocol` smart contract is the backbone of the Prosopo service, making payments between actors and storing data that can be used to resolve disputes. The nodeJS `Provider` service is designed to allow people to offer human verification services, currently in form of captchas, branching out into other formats in the future.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| 0a. | License |https://github.com/prosopo-io/provider/blob/master/LICENSE https://github.com/prosopo-io/protocol/blob/master/LICENSE https://github.com/prosopo-io/dapp-example/blob/master/LICENSE| The links are to the main license files. The individual source files also have license headers.| \n| 0b.  | Documentation | https://github.com/prosopo-io/provider/blob/master/README.md https://github.com/prosopo-io/protocol/blob/master/README.md https://github.com/prosopo-io/integration/blob/main/README.md | The README files explain how to use each repository. However, the repos are best used together in the integration repository. | \n| 0c.  | Testing Guide\t | https://github.com/prosopo-io/provider/blob/master/README.md https://github.com/prosopo-io/protocol/blob/master/README.md https://github.com/prosopo-io/integration/blob/main/README.md | The README files contain details of how to run the tests. We've created a branch in each of our repositories called `milestone1`. We'd appreciate you using these branches when running the code. | \n| 0d.  | Docker |https://github.com/prosopo-io/provider/blob/master/dev.dockerfile https://github.com/prosopo-io/integration/blob/main/docker-compose.yml| A dockerfile exists for the Provider repo. The various repos are pulled together in the `integration` repository, in which a docker compose file spins up 3 containers  - `Provider`, `Substrate`, and `MongoDB`| \n| 0e.  | Article |https://github.com/prosopo-io/prosopo-website/blob/master/src/articles/prosopo-web3-foundation-grant.md| Website is not live | \n| 1.  | Prosopo Contract Development |https://github.com/prosopo-io/protocol/| The repo containing the smart contract | \n| 2.  | Prosopo Provider Service |https://github.com/prosopo-io/provider| The repo containing the Provider software | \n| 3.  | External Contract |https://github.com/prosopo-io/dapp-example| An external example contract which demonstrates how to call our contract | \n\n**Additional Information**\n\n- Our `Provider` node is currently architected as a series of TypeScript files that will be broken into sensible packages as part of Milestone 2. This is to allow re-use of components.\n\n- We recognise the `Protocol` contract is very long, and we will be migrating it to use [OpenBrush's contract library](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/tree/c71097ff10ef6d187bf9c86f0248bfbc6ec40a3c/docs/docs/smart-contracts) as part of Milestone 2.\n\n- Our original contract design involves checking captcha solutions for users within a timeframe. It has not been possible to unit test this as `block_timestamp` does not exist in the experimental `ink!` unit test engine. We are exploring alternatives for this feature as part of Milestone 2.\n\nAs part of this Milestone we contributed PRs and comments to various Polkadot ecosystem projects.\n\n- https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node/pull/24\n- https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/1080 (Not yet merged but required to run our contract)\n- https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/1116 (WIP)\n- https://github.com/patractlabs/redspot/pull/169\n- https://github.com/patractlabs/redspot/pull/166\n- https://github.com/patractlabs/redspot/pull/164\n- https://github.com/patractlabs/redspot/pull/154\n- https://github.com/patractlabs/redspot/pull/153\n- https://github.com/patractlabs/redspot/pull/153\n\n",

Licenses\n\nLicenses differ per package. All licenses are either MIT, GPLv3, or Apache License 2.0.\n\n### 0b. Documentation\n\nThere is a repository called [client-example](https://github.com/prosopo-io/client-example) that demonstrates how to\nintegrate the [procaptcha-react](https://github.com/prosopo-io/procaptcha-react) package into a React app.\nProcaptcha-react is a wrapper of [procaptcha](https://github.com/prosopo-io/procaptcha), which is an interface to\nthe [provider](https://github.com/prosopo-io/provider) API and the [protocol](https://github.com/prosopo-io/protocol)\nsmart contract. The documentation consists of the READMEs in these repositories. The architecture\nis [documented in our proposal](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/prosopo.md#24-architecture)\n.\n\n### 0c. Testing Guide\n\nDue to the nature of blockchain development, there was not much we could do in terms of unit tests for the frontend, as\nalmost every operation depends on either the [provider](https://github.com/prosopo-io/provider) API or a contract\nquery/transaction. Therefore, there are minimal unit tests in the [procaptcha](https://github.com/prosopo-io/procaptcha)\nrepository that test the state and context reducers. All other functionality is covered by the integration tests that\nare part of the [provider](https://github.com/prosopo-io/provider#tests) repository.\n\n### 0d. Docker\n\nThe [demo docker file](https://github.com/prosopo-io/integration/blob/milestone2/docker-compose.demo.yml) is the most feature\nfilled docker file we have. It starts a pre-populated substrate node, a mongo db, and\na [provider](https://github.com/prosopo-io/provider) node running a captcha API. The developer is then expected to run\neither [client-example](https://github.com/prosopo-io/client-example#how-to-run-locally)\nor [demo-nft-marketplace](https://github.com/prosopo-io/demo-nft-marketplace#how-to-run-locally).\n\n### 0e. Article\n\nhttps://github.com/prosopo-io/prosopo-website/blob/milestone2/src/articles/prosopo-completes-web3-foundation-grant.md\n\n### 1 Prosopo Client SDK\n\n[procaptcha](https://github.com/prosopo-io/procaptcha) is the main package that communicates with\nthe [provider](https://github.com/prosopo-io/provider) API and the\n[protocol](https://github.com/prosopo-io/protocol) smart contract. Procaptcha is designed to be used by a user\ninterface package, such as [procaptcha-react](https://github.com/prosopo-io/procaptcha-react).\n\n### 2 Demo Website\n\n[https://nft.demo.prosopo.io](https://nft.demo.prosopo.io) is a fully fledged NFT marketplace that demonstrates how the\ncaptcha UI works in a website and in a contract simultaneously. The website is protected by a captcha user interface -\nthe \"Select All\" images captcha. The PSP34 contract in the background is protected by\nthe [protocol](https://github.com/prosopo-io/protocol) smart contract by using the `is_human` function.\n\n### 3 Integration Scripts\n\nThe [developer set up instructions](https://github.com/prosopo-io/integration/tree/develop#development-environment-set-up)\ncan be used to evaluate the integration repository.\n",

This pallet will sum the transaction fees on a Substrate chain over a period of blocks and send a percentage of them to the Sequester Common Good chain, where they will be used to purchase carbon credits. These carbon credits will then be permanently retired and removed from circulation.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n[Sequester Donations Pallet](https://github.com/SequesterChain/pallets/tree/main/donations) - The Sequester donations pallet, which aggregates transaction fees over a period of time and sends a percentage of them to the Sequester Common Good chain.\n\n[Sequester Example Node](https://github.com/SequesterChain/sequester-example-node) - An example Substrate chain that integrates with the Sequester donations pallet\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| 0a. | License | [License Link](https://github.com/SequesterChain/pallets/blob/main/donations/LICENSE)| Apache 2.0 |\n| 0b.  | Documentation |[Documentation Link](https://github.com/SequesterChain/pallets/tree/main/donations#documentationconfiguration-options)| We've provided inline documentation of the code, a README file with documentation on our configuration options, and an in depth Medium article (Number 3 below) describing our approach and instructions for integration. |\n| 0c.  | Testing |[Testing Link](https://github.com/SequesterChain/pallets/tree/main/donations#testing)| Our core functionalities are unit tested.  These tests can be run as described in the Readme file linked.|\n| 0d.  | Docker |[Docker Link](https://github.com/SequesterChain/sequester-example-node#run-in-docker)| We've included Dockerfiles in our example node to ensure consistent versioning and dependencies. |\n| 1.  | Calculate Transaction Fees |[Calculate Txn Fees Link](https://github.com/SequesterChain/pallets/blob/w3f_milestone_1_submission/donations/src/lib.rs#L192-L211)| Each block, an offchain worker will sum the fees for that block, multiply that sum * the percentage of fees we are sending to Sequester, and store those fees in an offchain variable. Every `OnChainUpdateInterval` blocks, an unsigned transaction will be submitted on-chain, to queue those funds to be sent to Sequester.|\n| 2.  | Send to Sequester |[Send To Sequester Link](https://github.com/SequesterChain/pallets/blob/w3f_milestone_1_submission/donations/src/lib.rs#L327-L362)| Every `SpendPeriod` blocks (a variable passed into `pallet_treasury`), the treasury will will the `SpendFunds` hook, which will check the on-chain storage for queued txn fees. If there are valid txn fees, they will be subsumed into a special Sequester account, and an XCM will be constructed which sends the queued funds to the Sequester chain. Please note that the XCM call will remain mocked until the final architecture of the Sequester Common Good Chain is finalized.|\n| 3.  | Article/Tutorial | [Article Link](https://medium.com/@sequester.chain/introducing-sequesters-donations-pallet-3e55f54cdfd1) | We've posted a Medium article with an overview, general approach, integration tutorial, testing details, and next steps.|\n| 4.  | Weight estimation |[Weights Estimation Link](https://github.com/SequesterChain/pallets/blob/main/donations/src/weights.rs)| We've provided weights for our pallet generated through benchmarking.|\n\n## Additional Information\n\nWhile we considered using signed transactions to enhance security of the donations pallet, we observed that the [Elections pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/frame/election-provider-multi-phase/src/lib.rs#L1133-L1136) in Polkadot uses unsigned transactions. We used a similar model for our pallet and will verify with core Substrate devs that unsigned transactions will provide sufficient security for our implementation before going live.\n",

Sol2Ink can now transpile basically any valid Solidity contract. Moreover, Sol2Ink can now parse a whole project. Currently Sol2Ink should be able to transpile any complex solidity project. However, the developer needs to check the contract and fix some issues which may occur after building (for example hex literals, address literals, string cloning). We aim to produce fully compilable ink! contracts in future updates. \n\n**Deliverables**\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| 0a | License | https://github.com/727-Ventures/sol2ink/blob/main/LICENSE | MIT License |\n| 0b | Documentation | https://727-ventures.github.io/sol2ink/ | Code is documented with inline docs. Detailed documentation is provided as well. |\n| 0c | Testing and Testing guide | Sol2Ink is covered by [several unit tests](https://github.com/727-Ventures/sol2ink/blob/main/src/parser.rs#L1680), which run the parser on an input contract, and expect correct outputs of the parser, and one integration test, which tests many Solidity contracts with different features, therefore ensuring the correct behavior of Sol2Ink, see [test folder](https://github.com/727-Ventures/sol2ink/tree/main/tests) and [examples](https://github.com/727-Ventures/sol2ink/tree/main/examples) which we test. | Added unit tests which test if new changes to the application change the output.

Some features are harder to implement and we identified them as out of scope of this grant. For example, a parsed contract may fail to compile, because it contains two functions with the same name because Solidity allows overloading. Another example is with generalization, where Sol2Ink is able to identify a contract's base, but the user will have to do some cosmetic changes to implement the bases for the traits of the contract. We plan on implementing these and more features.\n\n**Testing Guide**\n\n- Deliverable 0b and 1\n   - We created a detailed documentation which is also available at this [website](https://727-ventures.github.io/sol2ink/), as well as covered basic functionality of Sol2Ink with inline documentation\n- Deliverable 0c and 0d\n   - We created a [unit test](https://github.com/727-Ventures/sol2ink/tree/main/tests), which runs Sol2Ink on the example Solidity contracts, and checks if there are any changes. If yes, the test fails and the developer either made some mistake, or changed the behavior of Sol2Ink, therefore they need to update the content of `tests/generated` with newly parsed examples.\n   - This test is also run by the [CI](https://github.com/727-Ventures/sol2ink/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml) on PR to main and develop branch.\n   - You can run these tests with `cargo test`\n- Deliverable 2\n  - Parsing any Solidity contract with Sol2Ink will generate a comprehensive file structure. You can see what the result structure looks like on [this page](https://727-ventures.github.io/sol2ink/capabilities), and you can test it by running Sol2Ink on some Solidity contract.\n- Deliverables 3 - 3e.\n  - All of the mentioned fixes were implemented in Sol2Ink. The crucial point is Deliverable 3e., which says Sol2Ink will be able to parse Uniswap, which implements the code which was previously parsed incorrectly. We parsed Uniswap V2 with Sol2Ink, you can check the result [here](https://github.com/727-Ventures/sol2ink/tree/main/uniwap_v2). You can test it yourself, by either running Sol2Ink on the provided folder with all Uniswap V2 files, or download them yourself from the official Uniswap github - [Uniswap v2-core](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core) and [Uniswap v2-periphery](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery).\n- Deliverable 4\n  - Sol2Ink will now parse Solidity library and produce a Rust file, which can be then imported in the parsed contracts. Our examples contain the [SafeMath library](https://github.com/727-Ventures/sol2ink/blob/main/examples/SafeMath.sol) which is parsed into this [library file](https://github.com/727-Ventures/sol2ink/blob/main/tests/generated/src/libs/safe_math.rs).\n- Deliverable 5\n  - Sol2Ink will implement the bases of a contract for the resulting contract. [This example](https://github.com/727-Ventures/sol2ink/blob/main/examples/ERC20.sol) contract inherits some bases, and you can see them implemented for such contract in [this parsed file](https://github.com/727-Ventures/sol2ink/blob/main/tests/generated/contracts/erc_20/lib.rs). You can test it yourself by parsing a contract which inherits other contracts.\n- Deliverable 6\n  - Sol2Ink now has an option to parse either single file or whole directory. In this case, it will traverse the file tree of the directory and parse all Solidity files within the tree, adding all of the transpiled files to the generated file structure. You can test this by creating a folder containing multiple folders with Solidity contracts, and running Sol2Ink with the folder as an argument, or you can try to parse our [examples folder](https://github.com/727-Ventures/sol2ink/tree/main/examples).\n- Notes\n  - Prior to testing, make sure that you have the nightly toolchain of rust installed. You can install it by `rustup toolchain add nightly`.\n\n",

| We have replaced the MemoryDB which would have been a hashmap with an in-memory array because it is much cheaper to lookup items in an in-memory array as compared to using a mapping. Solidity does not support in-memory mappings, and they can only be created in storage. With this change, we have successfully reduced the storage costs and improved the overall efficiency.

The module consists of a frame pallet in the frame directory and a starks verifier in the primitive directory. The starks proof generation function is not used on chain—thus it has been removed. Related rpc interfaces are added for demo purpose. |\n| 2. | Substrate chain |[Starks Node](https://github.com/gbctech/starks-node)| One can clone this repo and run `cargo build --release` to build the binary for the chain.

Both can works for the [canvas-node v0.1.4](https://github.com/paritytech/canvas-node/releases/tag/v0.1.4). We use [polkadotjs portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:9944) to deploy and make transaction under dev mode(`./canvas --dev`).<br />Note: demos are not fully compatible with the manually edited metadata json |\n\n## Additional Information\n\nIn milestone 1, we provide basic contract library environment with essential core compoments implemented. The library is quite experimental and we keep on improving the api abstraction.  Due to the complexity to implement an off-chain environment like ink!, the tests does not cover the seal api and its contract environment. There are two contract example to demonstrate how subscript library works. The Flipper contract imports low-level api to interact with the contract node and ERC20 contract demonstrate more complex feature. The delivery is actually the milestone 1 of the [General-Grants-Program Application](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/pull/336) and so metadata and storage layout are beyond the milestone's feature. Therefore both demos are not fully compatible with the manually edited metadata json. It needs more work to write general purpose contract and we are still working on the project to implement the future milestone.",

We went a step further and included in the design some of the features that can be additionally developed such| \n| 2.  | Backend - PostgreSQL database, node.js project setup |[Backend](https://github.com/MVPWorkshop/substrate-startkit-gui-api)|The back-end is a node.js project with Express framework coded in typescript for its strong encouragement of defining every bit of data in the code and minimizing any inconsistencies and reducing the possibility for buggy code. The database we chose is PostgreSQL in combination with Sequelize ORM for nodejs.| \n| 3.  | GUI web application |[Repository](https://github.com/MVPWorkshop/substrate-startkit-gui-app)| The front-end is a classic React SPA project which will be communicating with the backend through REST API It's written completely in typescript with a strong awareness on rock solid typization which also serves as the first barrier for bad code practices, buggy code and better readability. The design methodology we are following is \"Atomic design\", which is consisted of five fundamental building blocks called    - Atoms    - Molecules    - Organisms    - Templates    - Pages Following the Atomic design patterns, consistency, modularity and scalability is ensured while still embracing componentized nature of react. As for styling, we're using Bootstrap 4 to supercharge the development time and ensure consistent styling across the project. Naturally, because of using Bootstrap as our framework of choice, we're also using scss as our preprocessor.| \n| 4.  | Documentation & specification |[Product Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gZSNviJ1wiWDO7MtCEHFPWFfCxMs2ENefA-HhfQn4zw/edit#), [Configuration files(pallet-config branch)](https://github.com/MVPWorkshop/substrate-startkit-gui-api/tree/feature/pallet-config/src/pallets)| We want to enable the user to choose from a list of the most popular pallets. Once the user submits his credentials we will deploy blockchain with pre-defined pallet configurations. In case the user wants to adjust them, he can do it by editing code outside of our application. We created configuration files that will be autogenerated. Configuration files for contracts and balance pallets are linked in the left column as well as READ.ME that explains the rules of writing configuration files. | \n| 5.  | Github Authentication  |[Auth](https://github.com/MVPWorkshop/substrate-startkit-gui-api)| User will authorize us to create a repository and deploy his tailored made blockchain.| \n\n\nAs previously mentioned, we concentrate on research and ensuring that there are no impediments that will block us during the development of the other features. \nWe focused on the unknowns, such as pallet dependencies and the way users can authorize our app to create and deploy code in his repository. \n\nThus, we included Github Auth delivery in Milestone 1 (instead of Milestone 2) and we left Continuous Integration environment and Automated tests for Milestone 2 since it makes much more sense to cover it in a later stage of the development.\n\nAlso, the plan of the development and future actions may be found on the August-September roadmap - [link](https://monosnap.com/file/Pr9F2EgYtvxnmWfDCWDnhUy5YtlUtp)\n",

To do this it will verify that the incoming request is compatible with one of the profiles associated in the configuration, if so it will save the request in the Triage (and return an Guid to client) which will then be processed by the next service. In case the incoming request does not match any profile, it will be rejected. The Triage operation does not involve any concurrent processing, allowing for seamless scalability. It can accept requests simultaneously or even create multiple endpoints. The API expects a POST call with the following data: field Code used as a Key in the smart contract, field valueData used as one of the elements of the Value and the field Category that will be used to associate a profile with Tracking |\n| 2. | Aggregator Pool Worker | [SOURCE](https://github.com/TrackingChains/TrackingChain/tree/v0.1.0-alpha/src/AggregatorPool.Worker) [BINARY](https://github.com/TrackingChains/TrackingChain/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha) | Written in C#,The Aggregator Pool Worker will used to transfer processable data from Triage that has no time dependencies into the Pool.

In this case each worker instance takes one of the transactions entered into the pool and will process it by calling the selected smartcontract (this selection of smartcontract has already been made by Triage). Once the transaction has been made, it will save the HASH of the Tx so that it can be used by the next service. This service supports both (Ink! and EVM) TrackingChain smart contracts. The selection of the version of the smart contract to use will be given by the profile that was associated in the Triage phase |\n| 4. | Tx Watcher Worker | [SOURCE](https://github.com/TrackingChains/TrackingChain/tree/v0.1.0-alpha/src/TransactionWatcher.Worker) [BINARY](https://github.com/TrackingChains/TrackingChain/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha) | Written in C#,The Tx Generator Worker Worker will used to check all Tx pending for finalized (or failed) status. Each worker instance takes a pending transaction and through the hash it will verify if it has been finalized successfully. This service supports both (Ink! and EVM) TrackingChain smart contracts.

A get call will also be available, which given a \"Key\" byte32 returns the entire \"Value\" list of Bytes saved over time, also providing the block number in which the transaction was carried out. It will also include the C# function that the \"Tx Generator Worker\" service will have to do to write onchain and the read call that will be used by the \"Tx Watcher Worker\" service. The implementation will partially reuse the [C# SubstrateGaming library](https://github.com/SubstrateGaming) |\n| 8. | EVM Smart contracts | [SOURCE](https://github.com/TrackingChains/EVMTrackingChain)  | We will deliver a set of EVM smart contracts that will able to track the key values.

Which is not very trivial so I'm available for a short call in which I show step by step an installation on Ubuntu and some Runs in real time to show how requests are intercepted and written onchain.  \nIn the milestone I also left the EVM smart contract project (although it is out of scope because the Ink smart contract was introduced for the grant, for this reason I did not include it in the guide in order to simplify the revision process. However, the EVM smart contract is present in the configuration database seed, so it can be used)\n",

It is analogous (and an alternative) to FRAME which uses the accounts model. This is the second of three milestones in the grant.\n\nIn this milestone we focused on the user experience for a Tuxedo based chain and implemented the CLI wallet. The wallet syncs with a node and allow a user to see their balance and send transactions. We also added in a concept of a `ThresholdMultiSignature` to allow for more versatile signing schemes.\n\nMeanwhile, we also improved the robustness of the Tuxedo framework, thinking of edge cases and improving the test coverage as we went. A major core change was that we changed the terminology to fall in line with the IOHK naming. `Redeemer` -> `Verifier`, `Verifier -> ConstraintChecker`, `Witness -> Redeemer`. We also allowed for a more powerful `ConstraintChecker` which can not only have access to the `DynamicallyTypedData` from the `Inputs` and `Outputs` of a transaction but also to actually have the ability to be passed the full `Outputs` of a transaction for the future implementation of coupling between Tuxedo pieces.  \n\n**Deliverables**\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link(s)       | Notes |\n| ------ | ----------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| 0a.    | License     | [LICENSE file](https://github.com/Off-Narrative-Labs/Tuxedo/blob/milestone-1/LICENSE) | Apache 2.0, as recommended | \n| 0b.    | Documentation | [Hosted Rustdocs](https://off-narrative-labs.github.io/Tuxedo), [Readme](https://github.com/Off-Narrative-Labs/Tuxedo/tree/milestone-1#readme) | We have detailed rustdocs throughout the project; they are also hosted.

So we have come to make a recursive algorithm that generates all types before using them. When the parser gets a request to generate a type, it first checks the type' type and then decides what to do next. Ink! Smart contracts can produce Composite, Variant, Sequence, Array, Tuple, Primitive, and we have a different approach for every type.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\n| 0a | License | https://github.com/Supercolony-net/typechain-polkadot/blob/master/LICENSE | MIT License |\n| 0b | Documentation | https://github.com/Supercolony-net/typechain-polkadot/tree/master/docs | We will add more documentation and examples in the second milestone with covering upcoming features and explaination of typechain logic. |\n| 1 | TS types | https://github.com/Supercolony-net/typechain-polkadot/blob/master/src/index.ts | While testing everything, we figured out that types for arguments and types for return values are not the same; for example, if we have u128 as an argument, we can pass number, string, BN, bigint, but polkadot.js if it's return type can return only number or string, so we are processing types depending on its usage. |\n| 2 | Runtime code | https://github.com/Supercolony-net/typechain-polkadot/tree/master/src/templates | We use the Handlebars library to quickly generate output files with template format (src/templates). |\n| 3 | Testing | https://github.com/Supercolony-net/typechain-polkadot/tree/master/tests | Covered psp22, psp34 and enums usage.\n| 4 | NPM Packaging | https://github.com/Supercolony-net/typechain-polkadot/packages/1500761 | In the 2nd Milestone we will have two packages for typechain: typechain and typchain-parser. |\n\n\n**Additional Information**\n\n#### General usage\n- Login to github npm registry with ```npm login --registry https://npm.pkg.github.com```\n- Create a new project with `npm init`\n- Create a new directory for your contracts' abi's (for example /artifacts)\n- Add .npmrc file to your project directory that will contain following:\n```npmrc\n@supercolony-net:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/\n\nengine-strict=true\n```\n- Add to your package.json file the following and install it with `npm i`;\n```json\n\"dependencies\": {\n  \"@supercolony-net/typechain-polkadot\": \"0.1.1\",\n  \"@types/node\": \"^17.0.34\",\n  \"ts-node\": \"^10.7.0\",\n  \"typescript\": \"^4.6.4\",\n  \"@polkadot/api\": \"^8.6.2\",\n  \"@polkadot/api-contract\": \"^8.6.2\",\n  \"@polkadot/keyring\": \"^9.3.1\",\n  \"@types/bn.js\": \"^5.1.0\"\n}\n```\n- Run typechain with\n```bash\nnpx typechain-polkadot --in artifacts --out out\n```\n",

We had some problems with new versions of substrate-contracts-node, before we used default gasLimit as -1 and now we are using just big number, feel free to check out our commit https://github.com/727-Ventures/typechain-polkadot/commit/710896c7b9f2677a97f7b84cbf035c5c8fb1996d in file packages/typechain-polkadot/src/output-generators/raw/_sdk/query.ts. We have created preprocessAbi function and added _ before each type’ display name, it was done because of polkadot-js can optimize usage of known types such as Balance, and change it interface that can break typechain-polkadot-parser. We figured out with ink! 4 update abi changed a little bit, and in some places we used raw abi (mainly in preprocessABI function) so we created __getV3 function that gets everything we need no matter which ink version we are using.

If so it could require significant upstream work, and if not a regression\n  we will consider punting it until a future maintenance contract.\n\nFor M2 we intend to quickly post an issue to `cargo-contract`'s issue tracker soliciting feedback\nabout how best to integrate the `wasm-opt` crate, and have that discussion drive our efforts.\n\nWe are considering adding an API that translates `wasm-opt` command line arguments\ninto our own builder API, for conveneince in porting code that uses the `wasm-opt` CLI\nto using the API. `wasm-pack` for example allows arbitrary arguments to be passed to `wasm-opt`,\nand integrating the API would require some backward-compatibility solution.\nAlong with this we are considering how to make it easy for integrators to quickly disable\nthe integrated `wasm-opt` API and Binaryen C++ build, and fall back to the CLI,\nin the case of unforseen problems.\n\nAs of now we believe that `wasm-opt`'s fuzzing capabilities are not important for our use cases,\nand intend to not include them in the API. Feedback welcome.\n\nWe are maintaining issues for the remaining work: https://github.com/brson/wasm-opt-rs/issues\n",

We will refer to moonbeam guides and documentation in this grant delivery document.  But the RPC implementation is actually contained in the frontier project (https://github.com/paritytech/frontier), which is included into moonbeam.  All of the moonbeam guides and docs can be run against the frontier node template as well, the only difference being that the frontier node template has a network id = 42, and moonbeam has a network id = 43.  Information on how to run it in a docker image are in the readme for the frontier node template (https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/tree/master/template).
